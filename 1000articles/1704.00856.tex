\section{Introduction}

The variation of Newton polygons of convergent $F$-isocrystals on algebraic varieties of characteristic $p > 0$ is mysterious. 
It may depend on the geometry of the varieties. In this paper we study the non-variation (i.e., constancy) of Newton polygons 
in projective smooth cases. 
We prove constancy of Newton polygons of all convergent $F$-isocrystals on Abelian varieties over finite fields. 
We also give several examples of projective smooth varieties such that any convergent $F$-isocrystal on the variety 
has constant Newton polygons. Applying the constancy, we prove the isotriviality of projective smooth families of such varieties. 

\subsection{Problems}
Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p$, $R$ a completely discrete valuation ring 
with residue field $k = R/\mathbf m$ where $\mathbf m$ is the maximal 
ideal of $R$, and $K$ the field of fractions of $R$ which is 
of mixed characteristic $(0, p)$. Let $\mathrm{ord}_p$ be the discrete valuation on $K$ normalized $\mathrm{ord}_p(p) = 1$. 
Let $\sigma$ be a $q$-Frobenius on $K$ for a positive power $q$ of $p$, that is, 
a continuous lift of the $q$-power Frobenius on $k$. (See the detail of Frobenius $\sigma$ in Remark \ref{frob}.) 

Let $X$ be a scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, and $\mathcal M$ a convergent 
$F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ with respect to Frobenius $\sigma$ which is introduced by P.Bertehlot \cite{Be0} \cite{Be} \cite{Be1}. 
By fixing a Frobenius $\sigma$ on $K$, it is only said to be a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ if there is no ambiguity. 
For a point $x \in X$ with a geometric point $\overline{x}$ above $x$, 
we define a polygon $\mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x)$, called Newton polygon of $\mathcal M$ at $x$, by 
the Newton polygon of the $F$-space $i_{\overline{x}}^\ast\mathcal M$ 
over $K(\overline{x})$ in the theory of Dieudonn\'e-Manin.  
Here $k(\overline{x})$ is a function field of $\overline{x}$ and $K(\overline{x})$ is an extension of $K$ 
with the residue field $k(\overline{x})$ as a discrete valuation field with the same valuation group, and 
$i_{\overline{x}} : \mathrm{Spec}\, k(\overline{x}) \rightarrow X$ is the canonical morphism. 
We normalize slopes by $\mathrm{ord}_p(a)/\mathrm{ord}_p(q)$ for any nonzero element $a$ of $K$ 
(note that $q$ is the $p$-power of Frobenius $\sigma$). 
We regard the application $x \mapsto \mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x)$ as a function 
on the scheme-theoretic points of $X$. 
The smallest slope of $\mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x)$ is called the initial slope of $\mathcal M$ at $x$. 

\begin{definition}\label{CNP} Let $f : X \rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}\, k$ be a morphism 
separated of finite type. 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item A convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $X/K$ is said to be constant if 
$\mathcal M \cong f^\ast\mathcal N$ for some $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal N$ on $\mathrm{Spec}\, k/K$. 
We denote  by $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}}$ the full subcategory of constant convergent $F$-isocrystals 
in the category $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)$ of 
convergent $F$-isocrystals on $X/K$.
\item A convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $X/K$ is said to have constant Newton polygons 
if the application $x \mapsto \mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x)$ is constant on $X$. 
We denote by $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}}$ 
the full subcategory of convergent $F$-isocrystals with constant Newton polygons 
in $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Our problems are as follow. 

\begin{problem}\label{prob} Let $X$ be a smooth and connected scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
and $X_{\overline{k}} = X \times_{\mathrm{Spec}\, k} \mathrm{Spec}\, \overline{k}$ for an algebraic closure 
$\overline{k}$ of $k$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the condition $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K) = F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}}$ 
equivalent to the triviality of geometrically etale fundamental group, i.e., $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{k}}) = \{ 1\}$?
Here $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(-)$ denotes the etale fundamental group 
and we usually omit to indicate a base point because we do not need it in this paper. 
\item Classify varieties $X$ such that any convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ has constant Newton polygons, 
i.e., 
$$
        F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K) = F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}}, 
$$
and study properties of such varieties. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

By definition there are natural inclusion relations 
$$
     F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}} \subset 
     F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}} \subset 
     F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K). 
$$
When $X = \mathbb P^1_k$ is the projective line, any convergent $F$-isocystal on $X/K$ is constant. 
Indeed, there is a natural isomorphism 
$$
      \mathcal M \cong\, H^0_{\mathrm{rig}}(\mathbb P^1_k/K, \mathcal M) \otimes_K \mathcal O_{]\mathbb P^1_k[}
$$
as $F$-isocrystals. Note that the isomorphism above holds without 
assuming the existence of Frobenius structures. 
On the other hand 
there exists a projective smooth curve $C$ over a finite field 
which has a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $C/K$ 
with nonconstant Newton polygons (see the detail in Section \ref{nonisotsec}). 
Hence, even if $k$ is a finite field, 
we know there exists a projective smooth curve $C$ such that 
$$
   F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(C/K)^{\mathrm{CST}} \subsetneq F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(C/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}} \subsetneq 
     F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(C/K). 
$$ 
The first inequality holds if $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(C_{\overline{k}})$ 
is nontrivial by Katz-Crew equivalence \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Cr} between 
the category of 
$p$-adic continuous representations of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(C)$ and 
that of unit-root convergent $F$-isocrystals on $C/K$. 

Our main interest is the mysterious gap 
of two categories $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}} \subset F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)$. 
In this paper we prove that the inclusion relations 
$$
   F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}} \subsetneq F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}} = 
     F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K). 
$$
holds for any Abelian variety over a spectrum $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ of a finite field $k$ (see Section \ref{conres}). 
However, the author is ignorant of classifications of projective smooth curves of genus $\geq 2$ 
in this aspect. 

Concerning to Problem \ref{prob} (1), H.Esnault and A.Shiho studied the constant problem, 
called de Jong conjecture \cite[Conjecture 2.1]{ES}, in the case 
of convergent isocrystals (without Frobenius structures). 
They proved the de Jong conjecture under certain conditions \cite{Shi} \cite{ES} \cite{ES2}. 
Moreover the constancy of geometric convergent isocrystals (see Definition \ref{gomF}) 
are proved in \cite[Theorem 1.3]{ES2}. 
As mathematical statements, the case of convergent isocrystals 
is much stronger than that of convergent $F$-isocrystals. However, our interests are the variation of Newton polygons 
and its application to geometry. 
Returning to our problems, if $X$ is proper smooth, 
then the triviality $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{k}}) = \{ 1\}$ is equivalent to the coincidence 
$$
     F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}} = F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}} 
$$
of categories (Corollary \ref{van}). 
At this moment we do not know whether Problem \ref{prob} (1) is valid or not in general. 

We study basic properties of variation of Newton polygons in the section $2$, 
and give a proof of the existence of slope filtrations of 
$F$-isocrystals with constant Newton polygons in our context in Appendix \ref{esf} (see Section \ref{frobslope}). 

\subsection{Constancy results}\label{conres}

Our main result is to give an example to Problem \ref{prob} (2). 

\begin{theorem}\label{abconst0} \mbox{\rm (Theorem \ref{abconst})} 
Let $k$ be a finite field, and $X$ an Abelian variety over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
Any convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ has constant Newton polygons, i.e., 
$$
   F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}} = F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K). 
$$
\end{theorem}

The crucial idea of the proof is as follows. Let $C$ be a projective smooth and 
geometrically connected curve of genus $\geq 1$, 
$\mathcal M$ a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $C/K$, and $D_{\mathcal M}$ 
a reduced divisor of $C$ consisting of points $x$ at which the Newton polygon $\mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x)$ 
is different from that at the generic point. 
Estimating the degree of $D_{\mathcal M}$ by two ways, the congruence of the $L$-function 
$L(X/k, \mathcal M; t)$ of $\mathcal M$ modulo $\mathbf m$ and the Euler-Poincar\'e formula (Proposition \ref{est}), 
we have a upper bound of the degree of $D_{\mathcal M}$ by a constant 
which depends only on the cardinal of $k$, the genus of $C$ and the 
rank of $\mathcal M$ (Theorem \ref{estjump} and Remark \ref{preest}). 

Now let $X$ be an Abelian variety over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
Let $\mathcal M$ be a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ with non constant Newton polygons, 
and $D_{\mathcal M}$ a set of $X$ consisting of points at which 
the Newton polygon of $\mathcal M$ is different from the Newton polygon at the generic point of $X$. 
Then $D_{\mathcal M}$ is a closed subscheme in $X$ purely of codimension $1$ 
by de Jong-Oort purity theorem \cite[Theorem 4.1]{DO}. 
In this situation one can take a projective smooth and geometrically connected curve $C$ of genus $\geq 1$ in $X$ 
(we may replace $k$ by a finite extension) such that 
the degrees of the reduced divisors $(D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C)_{\mathrm{red}}$ 
are unbounded on $n$, where $[n]$ means the morphism of multiplication on $X$ with a positive integer $n$. 
Since the rank of $[n]^\ast\mathcal M$ is stable for $n$, 
this contradicts to the existence of bound with respect to the $k$-curve $C$.  

\subsection{Application to the isotriviality of families of curves}\label{isotsec}
We will apply our study on constancy of Newton polygons to the isotiviality problem of families of curves in characteristic $p>0$. 
At first we recall the definition and review the case of complex algebraic varieties. 

\begin{definition}\label{Isot} Let $S$ be a scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
A smooth family $X$ over $S$ is isotrivial if, for any geometric points $s, t \in S(\overline{k})$, 
the geometric fibers $X_s$ and $X_t$ of $X$ at $s$ and $t$, 
respectively, are isomorphic to each other as schemes over $\mathrm{Spec}\, \overline{k}$. 
Here $\overline{k}$ is an algebraic closure of $k$. 
\end{definition}

In the case of complex algebraic varieties, the following results are known. 
Let $X$ be a projective smooth family of connected curves of genus $g \geq 2$ over $S$. 
If $S$ is either $\mathbb P^1$, $\mathbb C$, $\mathbb C^\times$, Abelian varieties, 
or simply connected (more generally the topological fundamental group 
$\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}(S)$ is finite), then the family $X$ is isotrivial 
over $S$ (see the detail in \cite{DM}).

When $k$ is a field of characteristic $p>0$, 
the isotriviality of families of curves over a projective smooth curve of genus $\leq 1$ 
is known. More generally L.Szpiro proved the isotriviality of 
semistable curves over a projective smooth curve of genus $\leq 1$ \cite[Th\'eor\`eme 4]{szpiro}. 

Our result is as follows. 

\begin{theorem}\label{isotcNP0} \mbox{\rm (Theorem \ref{isotcNP})} 
Let $S$ be a projective smooth and connected scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
and $f : X \rightarrow S$ a proper smooth family of connected curves. 
Suppose that any geometric convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $S/K$ (see Definition \ref{gomF}) 
has constant Newton polygons. 
Then the family $X$ over $S$ is isotrivial. 
\end{theorem}

If there exists at least a fiber which is a ordinary curve (see Definition \ref{ordi}) in the family $X$ over $S$, 
then $X$ is a family of ordinary curves over $S$ by 
the constancy hypothesis of Theorem \ref{isotcNP0}. 
In this case the family is isotrivial since the ordinary locus of coarse moduli scheme of Abelian varieties 
is quasi-affine \cite[XI, Th\'eor\`eme 5.2]{MB}. 
When there exists no ordinary point in $S$, we apply A.Tamagawa and M.Sa\"idi's works \cite{tam}, \cite{saidi} : 
there exists a finite etale covering $f' : Y' \rightarrow X'$ after a finite etale base change $S'$ of $S$ 
such that the new part $J(Y', X') = J(Y')/(f')^\ast J(X')$ of 
the relative Jacobian variety over $S'$ is ordinary. 
$J(Y, X)$ over $S$ is isotrivial and hence Torelli theorem for new parts \cite[Corollaries 4.7]{tam} 
implies the isotriviality of $X$ over $S$. 

The author is in ignorance whether the converse of the theorem above holds or not. 

\begin{corollary}\label{isotrivial} Suppose that $S$  is a projective smooth and geometrically 
connected scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ 
satisfying one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(S_{\overline{k}}) $ is finite. 
\item \mbox{\rm (Corollary \ref{isotab})} $S$ is an Abelian variety. 
\item $S$ is either a ruled surface over a curve of genus $\leq 1$ 
or a projective smooth surface of Kodaira dimension $0$. 
\end{enumerate}

Then any proper smooth family of connected curves over $S$ is isotrivial. 
\end{corollary}

In order to prove (1) it is sufficient to prove the assertion when $S$ is simply connected, i.e., 
the geometrically etale fundamental group $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(S_{\overline{k}})$ is trivial. 
Then any geometric convergent isocrystal on $S/K$ is constant by \cite[Theorem 1.3]{ES2}, 
so that it is also constant as a convergent $F$-isocrystal. 
The isotriviality follows from Theorem \ref{isotcNP}. 
(3) follows from the classification theorem of surfaces (see \cite{Li}, for example), 
the previous (1), (2) and Propositions \ref{dominant} and \ref{birat}. 

\begin{remark} The author does not know whether 
any convergent $F$-isocrystal on a simply connected variety is constant 
or not in general. 
In the following $S$ we know that any convergent $F$-isocrystal is constant when 
the field $k$ of definition is arbitrary: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S$ has a projective smooth lift $\mathcal S$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, R$ 
such that $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(\mathcal S_{\overline{K}}) = \{1 \}$ 
for the geometric generic fiber $\mathcal S_{\overline{K}}$. 
\item $S$ is separably rationally connected (see the definition in \cite[IV, Definition 3.2]{Ko}). 
\end{enumerate}
Indeed, 
in the case (1) any convergent isocrystal on $S/K$ is constant, 
by rigid and complex GAGA principles of de Rham cohomologies 
and \cite{Ma} \cite{Gr} (see Introduction of \cite{Shi}), 
so that it is also constant as a convergent $F$-isocrystal. 
In the case (2) any two points are connected by rational curves \cite[IV,Theorem 3.9]{Ko} and hence 
any convergent $F$-isocrystal has constant Newton polygons. Since the simply connectedness of 
separably rationally connected varieties 
follows from the work of A.J.De Jong-J.Starr \cite{DS} and J.K\'ollar (see \cite[Corollary 3.6]{De}), the assertion follows from 
Corollary \ref{van}. 
\end{remark}

\section{Newton polygon}

In this section we study several properties of Newton polygons. 

\subsection{Frobenius $\sigma$}

Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p > 0$, $R$ a completely discrete valuation ring 
with residue field $k = R/\mathbf m$, and $K$ the field of fractions of $R$ which is 
of mixed characteristic $(0, p)$. 
We fix a discrete valuation $\mathrm{ord}_p$ on $K$ (and its extension as valuation fields) which is normalized 
by $\mathrm{ord}_p(p) = 1$. 
Let $\sigma$ be a $q$-Frobenius on $K$ for a positive power $q$ of $p$, that is, 
a continuous lift of the $q$-power Frobenius on $k$. 

When we consider Katz-Crew equivalence between continuous $p$-adic representations 
and unit-root $F$-isocrystals \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Cr}, we assume that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $\mathbb F_q \subset k$ and 
\item[(ii)] $K_\sigma \otimes_{W(\mathbb F_q)}W(k) \cong K$, 
\end{enumerate}
where 
$\mathbb F_q$ is the finite field of $q$-elements, 
$K_\sigma$ is the $\sigma$-invariant 
subfield of $K$ and $W(k)$ is the ring of Witt-vectors with coefficients in $k$. 

\begin{remark}\label{frob} 
The above hypotheses (i) and (ii) on $K$ and $\sigma$ 
always hold if we replace $K$ 
by a finite unramified extension $K'$ of $K$. Indeed, for any $q$-Frobenius $\sigma$, there 
is a uniformizer $\pi$ of the $p$-adic completion $\widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}} = K \otimes_{W(k)}W(\overline{k})$ 
of a maximal unramified extension $K^{\mathrm{ur}}$ of $K$ such that 
which is $\sigma$-fixed, i.e., $\sigma(\pi) = \pi$. 
Here $\sigma$ also denotes the unique extension of Frobenius $\sigma$ on $K^{\mathrm{ur}}$. 
Since $(\widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}})_\sigma$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$, $\pi$ is algebraic over $K$. 
If we put $K'= K(\widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}})_\sigma(W(\mathbb F_q)[1/p])$ which is a composite of fields, 
then $K'$ is unramified over $K$ by $K' \subset \widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}}$ 
and $K_\sigma \otimes_{W(\mathbb F_q)}W(k') \cong K'$ for some finite extension $k'$ of $k$. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{Variation of Newton polygons}

Let $M$ be an $F$-space over $K$ with respect to Frobenius $\sigma$, that is, 
a $K$-vector space $M$ of finite dimension with a $\sigma$-linear bijection 
$$
        F : M \rightarrow M 
$$
which is called Frobenius. 
Suppose that the residue field $k$ is algebraically closed and fixed a uniformizer 
$\pi$ of $K_\sigma$. The category of $F$-spaces is semi-simple with simple objects 
$$
       E_{s/r} = K[F]/(F^r - \pi^s)\, \hspace*{5mm} \mbox{for}\, \, 
       (r, s) \in \mathbb Z_{> 0} \times \mathbb Z\,\,\mbox{with}\, (r, s) = 1
$$
where the relation $Fa = \sigma(a)F$ holds for any $a \in K$ in $K[F]$, by Dieudonn\'e-Manin's classification. 
The rational number $s\mathrm{ord}_p(\pi/q)/r$ is called slope of $E_{r, s}$ and its rank over $K$ is $r$. 
If $M = \oplus_iE_{r_i/s_i}^{m_i}$ with $s_1/r_1<s_2/r_2<\cdots<s_l/r_l$, then the Newton polygon of $M$ 
is the lower convex full of points 
$$
   \begin{array}{l}
     (0, 0), (m_1r_1, m_1s_1\mathrm{ord}_p(\pi/q)), 
     (m_1r_1+m_2r_2, (m_1s_1+m_2s_2)\mathrm{ord}_p(\pi/q)), \cdots, \\
    \hspace*{45mm}  (m_1r_1+\cdots +m_lr_l, (m_1s_1+\cdots+m_ls_l)\mathrm{ord}_p(\pi/q)).
     \end{array}
$$
Note that if $F = \pi\sigma$ of rank $1$, then it is of slope $\mathrm{ord}_p(\pi/q)$. Our definition of slopes 
is stable under the extension of scalar field $K$ and the change of power of Frobenius $\sigma$. 

Let $X$ be a scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ and $\mathcal M$ a convergent $F$-isocrystal 
on $X/K$. For a point $x \in X$ (not necessary a closed point) and for a geometric point $\overline{x}$ with a natural morphism 
$i_{\overline{x}} : \overline{x} \rightarrow X$, we define the Newton polygon of $\mathcal M$ at $x$ by 
that of $F$-space $i_{\overline{x}}^\ast\mathcal M$ 
over $K(\overline{x})$. Here $k(\overline{x})$ is the field of functions of $\overline{x}$, 
and $K(\overline{x})$ is the extension of $K$ as complete discrete valuation fields 
such that the residue field is $k(\overline{x})$. It is independent of the choice of geometric point $\overline{x}$ above $x$. 
We denote Newton polygon of $\mathcal M$ at $x$ by $\mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x)$. Then 
$$
       x \in X\,\, \mapsto\,\, \mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x)
$$ 
is a function on $X$. 

Let $\mathrm{NP}_1$ and $\mathrm{NP}_2$ be Newton polygons. We say that $\mathrm{NP}_1$ is above $\mathrm{NP}_2$, 
denote it by $\mathrm{NP}_1 \prec \mathrm{NP}_2$, 
if $\mathrm{NP}_1$ and $\mathrm{NP}_2$ has same endpoints and all polygons of $\mathrm{NP}_1$ is 
upper than or equal to that of $\mathrm{NP}_2$. 

\begin{proposition}\label{sp} \mbox{\rm (Grothendieck's specialization theorem \cite[Theorem 2.3.1]{Kat})} 
With the notation as above we have the following. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x, y \in X$. If $x$ is a specialization of $y$, then 
$\mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x) \prec \mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, y)$. 
\item Suppose $X$ is irreducible. 
If $\gamma$ is the initial slope of $\mathcal M$ at the generic point of $X$, then the set 
$$
     U = \{ x \in X\, |\, \mbox{\rm the initial slope of $\mathcal M$ at $x$ is $\eta$.} \}
$$
is open in $X$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

Another important property of variation of Newton polygon 
is the purity theorem of Newton polygons by A.de Jong and F.Oort. 

\begin{theorem}\label{Jort} \mbox{\rm (\cite[Theorem 4.1]{DO})} 
Let $X$ be a smooth irreducible scheme separated of finite type and 
$\eta$ a generic point of $X$. For a convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ 
on $X/K$, any generic point of the set-theoretical 
complement of the open subscheme 
$$
  U_{\mathcal M} = \{ x \in X\, |\, \mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x) = \mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, \eta) \}
$$
is of codimension $1$ in $X$. 
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Slope filtrations}\label{frobslope}

\begin{definition}\label{sfdef} Let $X$ be a scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, and 
$\mathcal M$ a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal M$ is said to be isoclinic of slope $\gamma \in\mathbb Q$ 
if, for any geometric point $\overline{x}$ of $X$ with a natural morphism $i_{\overline{x}} : \overline{x} \rightarrow X$, 
the $F$-space $i_{\overline{x}}^\ast\mathcal M$ over $K(\overline{x})$ is a direct sum of copies of 
$E_{\gamma/\mathrm{ord}_p(\pi/q)}$. 
\item An increasing filtration $\{S_\lambda \mathcal M\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb Q}$ of $\mathcal M$ as convergent 
$F$-isocrystals on $X/K$ is called the slope filtration if it satisfies the following conditions
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $S_\lambda \mathcal M = 0$ for $\lambda <\hspace*{-1.5mm}< 0$, 
$S_\lambda \mathcal M = \mathcal M$ for $\lambda >\hspace*{-1.5mm}> 0$ and 
$S_{\lambda+} \mathcal M = S_\lambda \mathcal M$ for any $\lambda$; 
\item[(ii)] $S_\lambda \mathcal M/S_{\lambda -} \mathcal M$ is 
either $0$ or isoclinic of slope $\lambda$ for any $\lambda$, 
\end{enumerate}
where $S_{\lambda -} \mathcal M = \cup_{\mu < \lambda} S_\mu \mathcal M$ 
and $S_{\lambda +} \mathcal M = \cap_{\mu > \lambda} S_\mu \mathcal M$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The existence of slope filtrations of $F$-crystals 
on $\mathrm{Spec}\, k[\hspace*{-0.4mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.4mm}]$ having constants Newton polygons up to isogenies 
was proved in \cite[Corollary 2.6.3]{Kat}, and 
the case of unipotent convergent $F$-isocrystals 
was proved in \cite[Th\'eor\`eme  3.2.3]{CLpente}. 
The existence of generic slope filtration for convergent $F$-isocrystals is proved in \cite[Proposition 5.8]{Shi0}. 
In the general case the existence of slope filtration is stated in \cite[Corollary 4.2]{Ke2}. 
The author does not find the detail of proof in the literature. So 
we prove the following theorem in Appendix \ref{esf}. 

\begin{theorem}\label{fil} 
Let $X$ be a smooth scheme separated of finite type over $k$, and $\mathcal M$ 
a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$. Suppose that the initial slope (i.e., the smallest slope) of $\mathcal M$ 
of the generic point of $X$ is $\gamma$ and the multiplicity of slope $\gamma$ 
of the induced $F$-isocrystal $i_x^\ast\mathcal M, (x \in X)$ is constant on $X$, say the rank is $r$. 
Then there exists a convergent sub $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal L$ of $\mathcal M$ on $X/K$ 
which is isoclinic of slope $\gamma$ and of rank $r$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{sf} Let $X$ be a smooth scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
and $\mathcal M$ a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ which has constant Newton polygons. 
Then $\mathcal M$ admits a unique slope filtration $\{S_\lambda \mathcal M\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb Q}$. 
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Properties of constancy of Newton polygons}

Let $X$ be a scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
and $\mathcal M$ a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$. 
We define the convergent cohomology of $X$ by 
$$
      H^i_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M) = I\hspace*{-1mm}H^i(]X[_{\mathcal P}, 
      \mathcal M \otimes \Omega_{]X[_{\mathcal P}/K}^\bullet).
$$
Here we take a closed immersion $X \rightarrow \mathcal P$ into 
a smooth formal scheme $\mathcal P$ over $\mathrm{Spf}\, R$,  
$]X[_{\mathcal P}$ is the associated rigid analytic tube \cite[Section 1.1]{Be}, 
and $I\hspace*{-1mm}H^i(]X[_{\mathcal P}, \mathcal M \otimes \Omega_{]X[_{\mathcal P}/K}^\bullet)$ is 
the hypercohomology of the de Rham complex $\mathcal M \otimes \Omega_{]X[_{\mathcal P}/K}^\bullet$ 
associated to the convergent isocrystal $\mathcal M$. 
The convergent cohomology is independent of the choice of the closed immersion $X \rightarrow \mathcal P$. 
In \cite{CT0} \cite{tsu} 
the convergent cohomology 
$H^i_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M)$ is denoted by $H^i_{\mathrm{rig}}((X, X)/K, \mathcal M)$, 
the rigid cohomology of $X$ overconvergent along $\emptyset$, namely, we do not consider the overconvergent 
regularity along boundary. 
When $\mathcal M = \mathcal O_{]X[}$ (the unit $F$-isocrystal), we simply denote 
the convergent cohomology by $H^i_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K)$. 
If $X$ is proper over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, then the convergent cohomology $H^i_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M)$ 
is nothing but the rigid cohomology $H^i_{\mathrm{rig}}(X/K, \mathcal M)$. 
The convergent isocrystal is furnished with a $\sigma$-linear homomorphism 
$$
        F : H^i_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M) \rightarrow H^i_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M)
$$
In general $H^i_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M)$ 
is not of finite dimension over $K$ and $F$ does not acts on $V$ bijectively except $i = 0$. 
For a $K$-vector space with $\sigma$-linear homomorphism  
$F : V \rightarrow V$, we define a $K$-space $V_{\mathrm{fin}}$ by the subspace of 
$V$ consisting of elements $w$ 
such that there exist elements $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n \in K$ with $a_n \ne 0$ 
satisfying $F^nw + a_1F^{n-1}w + \cdots + a_nw = 0$. In the case of rigid cohomology 
we have an equality $H^i_{\mathrm{rig}}(X/K, \mathcal M)_{\mathrm{fin}} = 
H^i_{\mathrm{rig}}(X/K, \mathcal M)$. 

\begin{proposition}\label{Abel} Let $0 \rightarrow \mathcal L \rightarrow \mathcal M \rightarrow \mathcal N \rightarrow 0$ 
be an exact sequence of $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal M$ is an object in $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}}$ 
if and only if both $\mathcal L$ and $\mathcal N$ are so.
\item If $\mathcal M$ is an object in $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}}$, 
then so are both $\mathcal L$ and $\mathcal N$. Suppose furthermore that 
$H_{\mathrm{conv}}^1(X/K)_{\mathrm{fin}}  = 0$. Then the converse holds.
\end{enumerate}
In particular, the category 
$F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}}$ (resp. 
$F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}}$) is an Abelian subcategory 
of $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)$. 
\end{proposition}

\vspace*{3mm}

We give several properties of constancy of Newton polygons. 

\begin{proposition}\label{dominant} 
Let $f : X \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that $Y$ is smooth and the set-theoretical complement of the image $f(X)$ in $Y$ 
is of codimension $\geq 2$. 
If any convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ has constant Newton polygons, then 
the same holds for any convergent $F$-isocrystal on $Y/K$. 
\item Suppose that the morphism $f$ is finite etale. 
If any convergent $F$-isocrystal on $Y/K$ has constant Newton polygons, then 
the same holds for any convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {(1) follows from Theorem \ref{Jort}.

(2) Let $f_{\mathrm{rig} \ast} : F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K) \rightarrow F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(Y/K)$ 
be the push forward induced by the finite etale morphism $f : X \rightarrow Y$. 
For a convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $X/K$ and a point $x \in X$, the Newton polygon of 
 $f_{\mathrm{rig} \ast}\mathcal M$ at a point $f(x)$ is a $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ time Newton polygon $\mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x)$. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\begin{proposition}\label{birat} 
Let $X$ and $Y$ be projective smooth and connected 
schemes over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ 
are binational over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
Any convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ 
is constant (resp. has constant Newton polygons) if and only 
if the same holds for any convergent $F$-isocrystal on $Y/K$. 
\end{proposition}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {Since the set of fundamental points of binational transformations is closed of codimension $\geq 2$ 
\cite[V, Lemma 5.1]{Ha}, 
the assertion follows from K.Kedlaya's extension theorem \cite[Proposition 5.3.3]{Ke} (via 
the extension of overconvergent $F$-isocrystals) and Theorem \ref{Jort}. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\subsection{Geometric $F$-isocrystals}

\begin{definition}\label{gomF} Let $S$ be a scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
A convergent isocrystal (resp. $F$-isocrystal) $\mathcal M$ on $S/K$ is geometric 
if there exists a proper smooth morphism $f : X \rightarrow S$ 
such that $\mathcal M$ is isomorphic to a subquotient of the relative rigid cohomology 
$R^if_{\mathrm{rig} \ast}\mathcal O_{]X[}$ of $X$ over $S$ for some integer $i$ 
as a convergent isocrystal (resp. $F$-isocrystal). 
\end{definition}

Since $f : X \rightarrow S$ is proper smooth, the rigid cohomology is nothing but the convergent cohomology 
of A.Ogus in \cite{Og} and the finiteness theorem below holds 
(see the detail around Berthelot's conjecture of coherency of relative rigid cohomology in \cite{La}). 
Hence the above definition makes sense. 

\begin{theorem}\label{coh} \mbox{\rm (\cite[Sect. 3]{Og})} With the notation as above, 
suppose that $S$ is smooth over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
Then for any convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $X/K$, 
the relative rigid cohomology $R^if_{\mathrm{rig} \ast}\mathcal M$ is a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $S/K$. 
\end{theorem}

We will use the following proposition to reduce the problem in the case where 
the field $k$ of definition is a finite field. This similar argument is discussed in \cite[Section 5.4]{ES2}. 

\begin{proposition}\label{geom} Let $\kappa$ be a perfect field, 
$\mathcal T$ a smooth integral scheme separated of finite type over 
$\mathrm{Spec}\, \kappa$, and $\mathfrak f : \mathcal X \rightarrow \mathcal S$ 
a proper smooth morphism of smooth schemes separated of finite type 
over $\mathcal T$. Let $k$ be a perfect field which includes 
the function field $\kappa(\mathcal T)$ of $\mathcal T$, and 
$f : X \rightarrow S$ the base change of $\mathfrak f : \mathcal X \rightarrow \mathcal S$ 
by the natural morphism $\mathrm{Spec}\, k \rightarrow \mathcal T$. 
Suppose that, for any closed point $t$ of $\mathcal T$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, \kappa$, 
the relative rigid cohomology $R^i\mathfrak f_{t, \mathrm{rig}\ast}\mathcal O_{]{\mathcal X}_t[}$ 
on $\mathcal S_t/K(t)$ has constant Newton polygons, where 
$\kappa(t)$ is the function field of $t$ and 
$K(t) = K_\sigma\otimes_{W(\mathbb F_q)}W(\kappa(t))$. Then the 
relative rigid cohomology $R^if_{\mathrm{rig}\ast}\mathcal O_{]X[}$ 
on $S/K$ has constant Newton polygons. 
\end{proposition}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {We may assume that $S$ is irreducible. 
Let $\mathcal U$ be an open subscheme of $\mathcal S$ consisting of points 
at which the Newton polygon of the relative 
rigid cohomology $R^i\mathfrak f_{\mathrm{rig}\ast}\mathcal O_{]{\mathcal X}[}$ 
coincides with that at the generic point of $\mathcal S$, and hence with that at the generic point 
of $S$. The open subscheme $\mathcal U$ 
is defined over $\mathrm{Spec}\, \kappa$ by Grothendieck's 
specialization theorem. If $\mathfrak g : \mathcal S \rightarrow \mathcal T$ 
denotes the structure morphism, then $\mathfrak g(\mathcal U)$ 
is an open subscheme of $\mathcal T$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, \kappa$ and 
$\mathfrak g^{-1}(\mathfrak g(\mathcal U)) = \mathcal U$. 
Hence $S \subset \mathcal U \times_{\mathcal T}\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, and 
$R^if_{\mathrm{rig}\ast}\mathcal O_{]X[}$ has constant Newton polygons on $S$. 
Note that, in our case the arbitrary base change theorem 
holds since the relative cohomology is coherent \cite[Corollary 2.3.3]{tsu}. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\subsection{Constant and constant Newton polygons}

\begin{proposition}\label{equiv}
Let $X$ be a smooth scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. Then the following conditions (i) and (ii) 
are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}} = F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}}$. 
\item[(ii)] $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{k}}) = \{ 1 \}$ and 
$H^1_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K)_{\mathrm{fin}} = 0$ (see the definition before Proposition \ref{Abel}). 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {(i) $\Rightarrow$ (ii) follows from Proposition \ref{Abel} and Lemma \ref{ext} below. 

Now we prove (ii) $\Rightarrow$ (i). There exists a natural commutative diagram 
$$
     \begin{array}{ccc}
     \mathrm{Rep}_{K_\sigma}(\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{k}/k)) &\overset{\cong}{\longrightarrow} 
&F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(\mathrm{Spec}\, k/K)^0 \\
     \downarrow & &\downarrow \\
     \mathrm{Rep}_{K_\sigma}(\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)) &\overset{\cong}{\longrightarrow} &F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^0. \\
\end{array}
$$ 
by Katz-Crew's equivalence between the category of $p$-adic continuous 
representations of etale fundamental groups 
and the category of unit-root (i.e., isoclinic of slope $0$) convergent 
$F$-isocrystals \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Cr}. Since there exists an exact sequence 
$$
      1 \rightarrow \pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{k}}) \rightarrow \pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X) 
      \rightarrow \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{k}/k) \rightarrow 1 
$$
of etale fundamental groups, the triviality  $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{k}}) = \{ 1\}$ implies 
the natural inverse image functor 
$$
F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(\mathrm{Spec}\, k/K)^0 
\rightarrow F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^0
$$
is an equivalence. Let $\mathcal M$ be a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ 
which is isoclinic, and take a finite extension $K'$ of $K$ 
whose valuation group contains $\gamma$. Let $k'$ be a residue field of $K'$, 
$X' = X \times_{\mathrm{Spec}\, k} \mathrm{Spec}\, k'$, and 
$\mathcal M'$ the inverse image of $\mathcal M$ on $X'/K'$. Then 
$\mathcal M'$ is a tensor product of a rank $1$ constant object and a unit-root object. 
Then we have an isomorphism 
$$
     H_{\mathrm{conv}}^0(X/K, \mathcal M) \otimes_K K' 
     \cong H_{\mathrm{conv}}^0(X'/K', \mathcal M')
$$
of $K'$-spaces of dimension $\mathrm{rank}\, \mathcal M$ by the unit-root case, 
and hence $\mathcal M$ is constant. 

Let $\mathcal M$ be an object in $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}}$ 
with a slope filtration $\{ S_\lambda\mathcal M\}$ (Corollary \ref{sf}). We have only to prove 
the slope filtration is split. This follows from the exact sequence
$$
     0 \rightarrow \mathcal L \rightarrow \mathcal M \rightarrow \mathcal N \rightarrow 0
$$
is split when $\mathcal L$ and $\mathcal N$ are isoclinic. 
Indeed, since $\mathcal L = \mathcal O_{]X[}\otimes_KH^0_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal L)$, 
we have 
$$
       H^1_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal L) \cong 
       H^1_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K) \otimes_KH^0_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal L). 
$$
Hence the vanishing $H^1_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K)_{\mathrm{fin}} = 0$ implies the splitting.} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

The cohomological interpolation of Hom and Ext for convergent isocrystals 
in \cite[Proposition 2.2.7]{Be} and \cite[Proposition 1.2.2]{CL} implies the lemma below. 

\begin{lemma}\label{ext} Let $\mathcal M, \mathcal N$ be convergent 
$F$-isocrystals on $X/K$, and let us denote a $K_\sigma$-space of 
homomorphisms as convergent 
$F$-isocrystals (resp. a $K_\sigma$-space of extension classes of convergent $F$-isocrystals) 
on $X/K$ by 
$\mathrm{Hom}_{\tiny \mbox{\rm $F$-Isoc}}(\mathcal M, \mathcal N)$ 
(resp. $\mathrm{Ext}^1_{\tiny \mbox{\rm $F$-Isoc}}(\mathcal M, \mathcal N)$). Then there is 
an exact sequence of $K_\sigma$-spaces:
$$
  \begin{array}{ccccccc}
  0 &\rightarrow &\mathrm{Hom}_{\tiny \mbox{\rm $F$-Isoc}}(\mathcal M, \mathcal N) &\rightarrow 
  &H^0_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M^\vee \otimes\mathcal N) 
  &\overset{1-F}{\rightarrow} &H^0_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M^\vee \otimes\mathcal N) \\
   &\rightarrow &\mathrm{Ext}^1_{\tiny \mbox{\rm $F$-Isoc}}(\mathcal M, \mathcal N) &\rightarrow 
  &H^1_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M^\vee \otimes\mathcal N) &\overset{1-F}{\rightarrow} 
  &H^1_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M^\vee \otimes\mathcal N). 
  \end{array}
$$
Here $\mathcal M^\vee$ is the dual of $\mathcal M$. 
If furthermore the residue field $k$ is algebraically closed, then 
the homomorphism $H^0_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M^\vee \otimes\mathcal N) 
\overset{1-F}{\rightarrow} H^0_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K, \mathcal M^\vee \otimes\mathcal N)$ 
is surjective. 
\end{lemma}

\vspace*{3mm}

The author does not know whether $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{k}}) = \{ 1 \}$
implies $H^1_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K)_{\mathrm{fin}} = 0$ or not in general because 
the convergent cohomology is huge in general. 
Esnault and Shiho proved the following theorem by a comparison with $\ell$-adic cohomology theory. 
Hence $H^1_{\mathrm{conv}}(X/K)_{\mathrm{fin}} = 0$ at least $X$ is proper. 

\begin{theorem}\label{vann} \mbox{\rm (\cite[Theorem 5.1]{ES2})}  
Let $X$ be a smooth connected scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
Suppose that either $X$ is proper over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ or $p \geq 3$.  
Then the triviality $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et, ab}}(X_{\overline{k}}) = \{ 1 \}$ implies the vanishing 
$H^1_{\mathrm{rig}}(X/K) = 0$. Here $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et, ab}}(X_{\overline{k}})$ is the maximal Abelian quotient 
of geometric etale fundamental group $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{k}})$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{van} 
Let $X$ be a smooth connected scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
Suppose that $X$ is proper over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
The equivalence $F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CST}} = F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}}$ 
of categories holds if and only if $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{k}}) = \{ 1 \}$. 
\end{corollary}

\section{Constancy of Newton polygons on Abelian varieties} 
In this section we prove any $F$-isocrystal on an Abelian variety over a finite field 
has constant Newton polygons. 

\subsection{An estimate of number of jumping points}

Suppose $k$ is a finite field of $q$ elements in this section. 
Let us denote an algebraic closure of $k$ (resp. the $p$-adic completion of a maximal unramified extension $R^{\mathrm{ur}}$ of $R$, 
resp. the field of fractions of $\widehat{R}^{\mathrm{ur}}$) 
by $\overline{k}$ (resp. $\widehat{R}^{\mathrm{ur}}$, resp. $\widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}}$). 
Let $\sigma$ be a $q$-Frobenius on $K$ such that $(\widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}})_\sigma = K$. 
When we replace $k$ by a finite extension $k'$ of $q^r$ elements, then we also change 
the Frobenius $\sigma$ by $\sigma^r$. 

Let $C$ be a projective smooth and geometrically connected curve of genus $g$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ 
with $p$-rank $e$, i.e., 
$$
   e = \mathrm{rank}_{\mathbb F_p}J(C)[p](\overline{k}) = \mathrm{dim}_KH^1_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K)^0.
$$
Here $J(C)$ is the Jacobian variety of $C$, $J(C)[p]$ is the subgroup scheme of $J(C)$ 
which is the kernel of the multiplication by $p$, $H^i_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K)$ 
is the $i$-th rigid cohomology of $C/K$, and $H^i_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K)^0$ 
is the unit-root subspace of the $F$-space $H^1_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K)$. 
Then $0 \leq e \leq g$. 

\begin{proposition}\label{est} With the notation as above, suppose $g \geq 1$. 
Let $\mathcal M$ be a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $C/K$ 
which satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] The initial slope of $\mathcal M$ at the generic point of $C$ is $0$ of multiplicity $1$; 
\item[(ii)] Let $U = \{ x \in C\, |\,  \mbox{the initial slope of $\mathcal M$ at x is 0}\}$ be an open subscheme of $C$ 
with the open immersion $j_U : U \rightarrow X$, 
$\mathcal L$ the rank $1$ unit-root convergent sub-$F$-isocrystal 
of $j^\ast\mathcal M$ on $U/K$ by Theorem \ref{fil}, and 
$\rho : \pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(U) \rightarrow R^\times$ 
the $p$-adic representation corresponding to $\mathcal L$ by Katz-Crew's equivalence. Then 
the representation $\rho$ satisfies 
$$
    \rho\, \equiv\, 1\, \, (\mathrm{mod}\, {\mathbf m}R). 
$$
\end{enumerate}
If $Z = C \setminus U$ is a reduced divisor of $C$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, then we have an inequality 
$$
       e + \mathrm{deg}\, Z \leq 1 + 2(g-1)\mathrm{rank}\mathcal M. 
$$
\end{proposition} 

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {If $U = C$, then 
there is nothing to prove. So we suppose $U \ne C$ and hence the rank of $\mathcal M$ is greater than or equal to $2$. 
Let us calculate the $L$-function 
$$
    L(C/k, \mathcal M; t) = 
     \displaystyle{\prod_{x : \mathrm{closed\, \, points\,\, of}\, C}
     \mathrm{det}(1-F_x^{\mathrm{deg}(x)}t^{\mathrm{deg}(x)}; i_x^\ast\mathcal M)^{-1}}
$$
of $\mathcal M$ modulo $\mathbf m$ by two ways. 
Here $\mathrm{deg}(x)$ is the degree of the function field $k(x)$ of $x$ over $k$ 
and $i_x : x \rightarrow C$ be the canonical morphism. 
At a closed point $x$ of $U$ all the $p$-adic valuations of Frobenius eigenvalues of $i_x^\ast\mathcal M$ 
except one eigenvalue which is $1$ modulo $\mathbf m$ are positive. 
At a closed point $x$ in $Z$ all the $p$-adic valuations of Frobenius eigenvalues of $i_x^\ast\mathcal M$ 
are positive. Hence we have 
$$
  \begin{array}{lll}
     L(C/k, \mathcal M; t)\, &\equiv\, 
     &\displaystyle{\prod_{x : \mathrm{closed\, \, points\,\, of}\, U} (1- t^{\mathrm{deg}(x)})^{-1}} \\
     &\equiv\, &\mathrm{Zeta}(C/k; t)\mathrm{Zeta}(Z/k; t)^{-1} \\
     &\equiv\, 
     &\displaystyle{\frac{\mathrm{det}(1-Ft; H^1_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K))\mathrm{Zeta}(Z/k; t)^{-1}}{1-t}}\, \, (\mathrm{mod}\, \, \mathbf m)
     \end{array}
     \leqno{(\ast)}
$$
in $k[\hspace*{-0.4mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.4mm}]$, 
where $\mathrm{Zeta}(C/k; t)$ (resp. $\mathrm{Zeta}(Z/k; t)$) is the zeta function of $C$ (resp. $Z$) over $k$. 
Since 
$$
     \begin{array}{l}
       \mathrm{deg}(\mathrm{det}(1-Ft; H^1_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K))\, (\mathrm{mod}\, \mathbf m)) = e \\
       \mathrm{deg}(\mathrm{Zeta}(Z/k; t)^{-1}\, (\mathrm{mod}\, \mathbf m)) = \mathrm{deg}(Z)
     \end{array}
$$
in $k[t]$, we have 
$$
  \mathrm{deg}((1-t)L(C/k, \mathcal M; t)\,  (\mathrm{mod}\, \, \mathbf m)) = e + \mathrm{deg}(Z). 
$$

On the other hand, let us calculate the $L$-function of  $\mathcal M$ modulo $\mathbf m$ using 
Lefschetz trace formula 
$$
 L(C/k, \mathcal M; t) = \prod_i \mathrm{det}(1 - Ft; H_{\mathrm{rig}}^i(C/K, \mathcal M))^{(-1)^{i+1}}
$$
for rigid cohomology \cite[Th\'eor\`eme 6.3]{ELS}. Let $\mathcal N$ be an irreducible subquotient of $\mathcal M$ 
as convergent $F$-isocrystals on $C/K$ such that $\mathcal N$ 
includes the generic slope $0$ part. Since any slope of Frobenius $F_x$ on $i_x^\ast\mathcal N$ 
at any point $x$ of $Z \ne \emptyset$ is positive, $\mathcal N$ is not constant and is of rank $\geq 2$. 
The Poincar\'e duality \cite[Th\'eor\`eme 2.4]{Be2} implies $H^i_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K,\mathcal N) = 0$ for $i = 0, 2$ 
and then $\mathrm{dim}_K\, H^1_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K,\mathcal N) \leq 2(g-1)\mathrm{rank}\, \mathcal N$ 
by Euler-Poincar\'e formula of rigid cohomology of curves \cite[Corollaire 5.0-12]{CM}. 
If $\mathcal N' \ne \mathcal N$ is a subquotient of $\mathcal M$, then 
any slope of Frobenius $F_x$ on $i_x^\ast\mathcal N'$ 
at any point $x$ is positive since the generic slope $0$ subquotient of rank $1$ is included in $\mathcal N$. 
It implies that any slope of Frobenius $F$ on the rigid cohomology $H^i_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K,\mathcal N')$ 
is positive for $i = 0, 1, 2$ if it does not vanish. 
Hence, we have a congruence 
$$
 L(C/k, \mathcal M; t)\,  \equiv\, \mathrm{det}(1 - Ft; H_{\mathrm{rig}}^1(C/K, \mathcal N))\, \, 
 (\mbox{mod}\, \, \mathbf m). 
$$
Since $\mathrm{dim}_K\, H^1_{\mathrm{rig}}(C/K,\mathcal N) \leq 2(g-1)\mathrm{rank}\, \mathcal N \leq 2(g-1)\mathrm{rank}\, \mathcal M$, 
we have a desired inequality. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\begin{corollary}\label{estmax} With the hypothesis of Proposition \ref{est}, $\mathrm{deg}(Z)$ 
is at most $1 + 2(g-1)\mathrm{rank}\mathcal M$. 
\end{corollary} 

\begin{theorem}\label{estjump} Let $C$ be a projective smooth and geometrically connected curve 
over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
For a convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $C/K$, we put a closed subscheme 
$$
      D_{\mathcal M} = \{ x \in C\, |\, \mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, x) \ne \mathrm{NP}(\mathcal M, \eta)\}, 
$$
regarded as a reduced divisor. Here $\eta$ is the generic point of $C$. Then, for any positive integer $r$, 
there exists a constant $B$ depending on $q$, the genus of $C$ and $r$ such that the inequality 
$$
     \mathrm{deg}(D_{\mathcal M}) \leq B 
$$
holds for any convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $C/K$ of rank $r$. 
\end{theorem} 

In order to apply Proposition \ref{est} we prepare the lemma below. 

\begin{lemma}\label{genericrank1} Let $Y$ be a geometrically connected scheme separated of finite type 
over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ , 
and let $\mathcal N$ be a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $Y/K$. 
Let $\gamma_1 < \cdots < \gamma_2 < \cdots <\gamma_m$ be the generic slopes of $\mathcal N$ 
with multiplicities $r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_m$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item For $l = 1, \cdots, m$, the exterior power $\wedge^{r_1 + \cdots +r_l} \mathcal N$ of $\mathcal N$ 
has an initial slope of $r_1\gamma_1 + \cdots + r_l\gamma_l$ with multiplicity $1$. 
\item Suppose the Newton polygon function $\mathrm{NP}(\mathcal N, -)$ is not constant on $Y$. 
Then, for some integer $1 \leq l < m$, there exists a point $y$ of $Y$ such that 
the initial slope of $\wedge^{r_1 + \cdots +r_l} \mathcal N$ at $y$ is greater than $r_1\gamma_1 + \cdots + r_l\gamma_l$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\noindent
{\sc Proof of Theorem \ref{estjump}.} Suppose $\mathcal M$ is an $F$-isocrystal on $C/K$ with 
nonconstant Newton polygons, 
and $\gamma_1 < \cdots < \gamma_2 < \cdots <\gamma_m$ the generic slopes of $\mathcal M$ 
with multiplicities $r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_m$. Then 
$$
   D_{\mathcal M} = \underset{l}{\bigcup} \left\{ x \in C\, \left|\, 
   \begin{array}{l} \mbox{The initial slope of $\wedge^{r_1 + \cdots +r_l} \mathcal M$ 
   at $x$} \\ \mbox{is greater than that at $\eta$.}\end{array} \right. \right\}. 
$$
Applying Lemma \ref{genericrank1} for each $\wedge^{r_1 + \cdots +r_l} \mathcal M$, we 
may suppose the initial generic slope of $\mathcal M$ is $0$ of multiplicity $1$ by a suitable twist of Frobenius. 
Replacing $\mathcal M$ by 
the tensor product $\mathcal M^{\otimes q-1}$, we may assume that 
$\mathcal M$ satisfies the conditions (i) and (ii) of Proposition \ref{est}. 
Then $\mathrm{deg}(Z)$ is bounded depending only on $q$, $g$ and $\mathrm{rank}\, \mathcal M$ 
by Corollary \ref{estmax}. 
Hence, the bound exists since the number of generic slopes is 
less than or equal to $\mathrm{rank}\, \mathcal M$
\hspace*{\fill} $\Box$

\begin{remark}\label{preest}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
More precisely, the upper bounds depend on the cardinal of the base field of definition of $\mathcal M$ 
on $C/K$. If there are a subfield $k_0$ of $k$, a projective smooth curve $C_0$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k_0$ and 
a convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M_0$ on $C_0/K_0$ ($K_0$ is a complete valuation subfield of $K$ with 
the residue field $k_0$) such that $\mathcal M$ is the inverse image of $\mathcal M_0$, 
then $\mathrm{deg}(Z)$ in Corollary \ref{estmax} and $\mathrm{deg}(D_{\mathcal M})$ in Theorem \ref{estjump}
are bounded by the constant depending not on the cardinal of $k$ but on the cardinal of $k_0$. 
\item One can take a upper bound $B = r + 2^{1 + (q-1)r}(g-1)$ 
in Theorem \ref{estjump}. 
This upper bound is not sharp. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\subsection{The case of elliptic curves} 
To clarify the idea of proof, we first prove the constancy theorem in the case of elliptic curves. 

\begin{theorem}\label{ECconst} Let $k$ be a finite field, and $X$ an elliptic curve  over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
Then any convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $X/K$ has constant Newton polygons. 
\end{theorem}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {Suppose $\mathcal M$ is an $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ with 
nonconstant Newton polygons. 
Let $D_{\mathcal M} \ne 0$ be the reduced divisor of $X$ consisting of the points $x$ such that 
$$
     \mathrm{NP}(X, x) \ne \mathrm{NP}(X, \eta)
$$
where $\eta$ is the generic point of $X$. 
Let $[n] : X \rightarrow X$ be the morphism of multiplication $n$ 
for a positive integer $n$. 
If $n$ is prime to $p$, then $[n]$ is a finite etale morphism and we have 
$$
     \mathrm{deg}(D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M}) = n^2\mathrm{deg}(D_{\mathcal M}). 
$$
It is a contradiction to the boundedness of $\mathrm{deg}(D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M})$ 
by Theorem \ref{estjump}. 
Therefore, any $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ has constant Newton polygons. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\subsection{The case of Abelian varieties}

In this section we prove our main theorem for general Abelian varieties. 

\begin{theorem}\label{abconst} Let $k$ be a finite field, and $X$ an Abelian variety over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ of dimension $g$. 
Any convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal M$ on $X/K$ has constant Newton polygons, i.e., 
$$
  F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K)^{\mathrm{CNP}} = F\mbox{-}\mathrm{Isoc}(X/K). 
$$
\end{theorem}

\noindent
{\sc Proof.} Suppose $\mathcal M$ is an $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ with 
nonconstant Newton polygons. 
Let $D_{\mathcal M} \ne 0$ be the reduced divisor of $X$ consisting of the points $x$ such that 
$$
     \mathrm{NP}(X, x) \ne \mathrm{NP}(X, \eta)
$$
as in the proof of Theorem \ref{ECconst}. Then 
$D_{\mathcal M}$ is purely of codimension $1$ by de Jong-Oort's purity theorem 
(Theorem \ref{Jort}). 
After replacing $k$ by a finite extension, 
we can find a projective smooth geometrically connected curve 
$C$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] For any closed integral subscheme $Z$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ of codimension $1$ in $X$, 
the set theoretical intersection $C \cap Z$ is nonempty; 
\item[(b)] $O \in C$ and $O \not\in D_{\mathcal M}$, 
\end{enumerate}
where $O$ is the origin of the Abelian variety $X$. 
Indeed, if we fix an embedding $X$ into a projective space, then 
by Bertini's theorem and Moishezon-Nakai's criterion of ampleness \cite[Appendix A, Theorem 5.1]{Ha},   
one can obtain a projective smooth geometrically connected curve $C$ in $X$ 
as an intersection of different $g-1$ hyperplane sections  
such that the condition (a) holds 
after replacing $k$ by a finite extension. 
Note that the genus of $C$ is greater than or equal to $g$ by weak Lefschetz theorem. 
Since $\mathcal D_{\mathcal M}$ is of codimension $1$, one can choose $C \not\subset D_{\mathcal M}$. 
Taking a translation by a $k$-rational point after replacing $k$ by a finite extension if necessary, 
we may also assume the condition (b). 

\begin{lemma}\label{cont} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any positive integer $n$, we have $C \cap D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \ne \emptyset$ 
and $C \not\subset D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M}$. 
\item If we put $\Omega = \{ x \in C(\overline{k})\, |\, x \in C \cap D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M}\, \, \mbox{for some}\, \, n > 0\}$, 
then $\Omega$ is infinite. 
\item If $D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C$ denotes the set theoretical intersection 
and $(D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C)_{\mathrm{red}}$ denotes a reduced divisor of $C$, then 
$$
   \underset{n}{\mathrm{sup}}\, \mathrm{deg}((D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C)_{\mathrm{red}}) = \infty. 
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {(1) It follows from the condition (a) and $O \not\in D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C$ for any $n$. 

(2) Suppose that $\Omega$ is finite, namely, $\Omega = \{ y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_s\}$. 
Let $n$ be a positive integer such that $n$ is a multiple of orders of all $y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_s$. 
Since $[n](y_i) = O$, $y_i \not\in D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C$ for any $i$. 
This contradicts to $C \cap D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \ne \emptyset$. 

(3) For a finite extension $k_r$ of $k$ of degree $r$, the cardinal of $X(k_r)$ is finite. Hence 
there is a properly infinitely increasing sequence $r_1 < r_2 < \cdots$ such that 
$x_{r_i} \in \Omega \cap X(k_{r_i})$ and $x_{r_i} \not\in X(k')$ 
for any proper subfield $k'$ of $k_{r_i}$ by (2). Since 
$C$ and $D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M}$ is defined over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
the cardinal of the set theoretical intersection $D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C$ is greater than or equal to $r_i$ 
if $x_{r_i} \in D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C$ because of Galois conjugation. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\vspace*{3mm}

Now we return to the proof of Theorem \ref{abconst}. 
Since $\mathrm{rank}\, [n]^\ast\mathcal M = \mathrm{rank}\, \mathcal M$ for any positive integer $n$, the 
degree of $(D_{[n]^\ast\mathcal M} \cap C)_{\mathrm{red}}$ in $C$ is bounded 
by a constant independent of $n$ by Theorem \ref{estjump} and Remark \ref{preest}. 
This contradicts to Lemma \ref{cont} (3). 
Therefore, any $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ has constant Newton polygons. 
\hspace*{\fill} $\Box$

\section{Isotriviality of a family of curves} 

In this section we study the isotriviality of projective smooth families of connected  
curves on Abelian varieties of characteristic $p > 0$. 
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$. 

\subsection{Isotriviality of families of ordinary abelian varieties}

We recall some definitions.

\begin{definition}\label{ordi} 
Let $\kappa$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p$ and $\overline{\kappa}$ an algebraic closure of $\kappa$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item An Abelian variety $S$ of dimension $g$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, \kappa$ 
is said to be ordinary if $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb F_p}S[p](\overline{\kappa}) = g$. 
Here $S[p]$ is the subgroup scheme defined by the kernel of multiplication with $p$. 
\item A projective smooth geometrically connected curve over $\mathrm{Spec}\, \kappa$ 
is said to be ordinary if the Jacobian variety $J(S)$ of $S$ is so.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{isNP}  Let $S$ be 
a projective smooth connected scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ such that 
any geometric convergent $F$-isocrystal on $S/K$ has constant Newton polygons. 
Suppose $f : X \rightarrow S$ is a polarized Abelian scheme relatively 
of dimension $g$ and of degree $d$.  
If there is a point $s \in S$ such that the fiber $X_s$ of $X$ at $s$ is an ordinary Abelian variety, 
then $X$ is isotrivial over $S$. 
\end{theorem}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {Let us consider the relative first rigid cohomology $R^1f_{\mathrm{rig} \ast}\mathcal O_{]X[}$ 
of the morphism $f : X \rightarrow S$ which is a convergent 
$F$-isocrystal on $S/K$ (see Theorem \ref{coh}). Since there is a point $s \in S$ such that $X_s$ is ordinary, 
$X$ is a family of ordinary Abelian varieties by our hypothesis on Newton polygons. 
Because the ordinary locus $\mathcal A_{g, d, k}^{\mathrm{ord}}$ of the coarse moduli scheme 
$\mathcal A_{g, d, k}$ of 
polarized Abelian varieties of dimension $g$ and of degree $d$ 
over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ is quasi-affine by \cite[XI, Th\'eor\`eme 5.2]{MB}, 
the canonical morphism $S \rightarrow \mathcal A_{g, d, k}^{\mathrm{ord}}$ is constant.} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\begin{corollary}\label{isJNP}  Let $S$ be 
a projective smooth connected scheme of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ such that 
any geometric convergent $F$-isocrystal on $S/K$ has constant Newton polygons. 
Suppose $X \rightarrow S$ is a projective smooth family of curves of genus $g$.  
If there is a point $s \in S$ such that the fiber $X_s$ of $X$ at $s$ is ordinary, 
then $X$ is isotrivial over $S$. 
\end{corollary}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {Consider the relative Jacobian variety $J(X/S)$ of $X$ over $S$. Then $J(X/S)$ is a family of polarized Abelian scheme 
over $S$ with a ordinary fiber $J(X/S)_s$. Then the family $J(X/S)$ is isotrivial by Proposition \ref{isNP}. 
Now apply the Torelli theorem (see \cite[Theorem 12.1]{Mi}, for example), and then the family $X$ is isotrivial over $S$. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\begin{corollary}\label{isocNP} Let $S$ be 
an Abelian variety over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, and 
$X$ a polarized Abelian scheme over $S$. 
If there exists a point $s \in S$ such that the fiber $X_s$ of $X$ at $s$ is an ordinary Abelian variety, then 
$X$ is isotrivial over $S$. 
\end{corollary}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {We have only to prove any geometric convergent $F$-isocrystal on $S/K$ has 
constant Newton polygons by Theorem \ref{isNP}. Let $Y \rightarrow S$ be a proper smooth morphism. 
Then there exist a smooth integral scheme $\mathcal T$ separated of finite type over a spectrum 
$\mathrm{Spec}\, \kappa$ 
of a finite field $\kappa$ such that 
$\kappa(\mathcal T) \subset k$, an Abelian scheme $\mathcal S$ over $\mathcal T$ and 
a proper smooth morphism $g : \mathcal Y \rightarrow \mathcal S$ 
such that the base change by the morphism $\mathrm{Spec}\, k \rightarrow \mathcal T$ is 
the given morphism $Y \rightarrow S$. Here $\kappa(\mathcal T)$ is the function field of $\mathcal T$. 
Then, for any closed point $t \in \mathcal T$,  
the relative rigid cohomology $\mathcal M = R^ig_{\mathrm{rig}\ast}\mathcal O_{]\mathcal Y[}$ 
has a constant Newton polygon on $\mathcal S_t$ by Theorem \ref{abconst}. 
Hence, any geometric convergent $F$-isocrystal on $S/K$ 
has constant Newton polygons by Proposition \ref{geom}. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\subsection{Isotriviality of family of curves over Abelian varieties}

We state the isotriviality of a family of curves. In the case $g \leq 1$ the isotriviality 
below is trivial without the hypotheses (i) and (ii) since the coarse moduli scheme $\mathfrak M_g$ 
of projective smooth curves of genus $g$ is affine. 
We will prove the following theorem in the rest of this section. 

\begin{theorem}\label{isotcNP} Let $S$ be 
a projective smooth and connected scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
and $f : X \rightarrow S$ a projective smooth family of connected curves of genus $g \geq 2$. 
Suppose that any geometric convergent $F$-isocrystal on $S/K$ 
has constant Newton polygons. 
Then the family $X$ over $S$ is isotrivial. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{isotab} Let $S$ be an Abelian variety over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$.
If $f : X \rightarrow S$ is a projective smooth family of connected curves, 
then the family $X$ over $S$ is isotrivial. 
\end{corollary}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {Since any geometric convergent $F$-isocrystal on $S/K$ has 
constant Newton polygons by the proof of Corollary \ref{isocNP}, 
the assertion follows from Theorem \ref{isotcNP}. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\subsection{Torelli theorem} 
In this subsection we recall Tamagawa's work in \cite{tam}. 
Let $X$ be a projective smooth curve of genus $g \geq 2$ 
over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 

\begin{definition}\label{gon} The gonality of $X$ is a minimum degree of 
nonconstant morphisms $X \rightarrow \mathbb P^1_k$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{exon} \mbox{\rm (\cite[Proposition 2.14]{tam})} Suppose that 
the $p$-rank of $X$ is neither $0$ nor $g$. For any sufficient large integer $n$ which is prime to $p$, 
there exists a finite etale morphism $Y \rightarrow X$ cyclic of degree $n$ 
such that the gonality of $Y$ is greater than or equal to $5$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark} In \cite[Proposition 2.14]{tam} the existence of $Y$ with gonality $\geq 5$ 
is proved with the assumption that $X$ is non-almost elliptic, i.e., the Jacobian variety 
$J(X)$ is not isogenous to $E^g$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label{newordtor} Let  $f : Y \rightarrow X$ be a finite etale morphism 
of projective smooth and connected curves over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
$J(X) = \mathrm{Pic}^0(X)$ and 
$J(Y) = \mathrm{Pic}^0(Y)$ the Jacobian varieties of $X$ and $Y$, respectively, and define 
the new part of Jacobian variety of $Y$ relatively to $X$ by the Abelian variety 
$$
       J(Y, X) = J(Y)/f^\ast J(X)  
$$
with a polarization. 
The finite etale covering $Y$ over $X$ is said to be new-ordinary if $J(Y, X)$ is an ordinary Abelian variety. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{neword} \mbox{\rm (\cite[Theorem 4.3.1]{ray}, \cite[Corollary 5.3]{tam})} 
Let $X$ be a projective smooth curve of genus $g \geq 2$. 
For any sufficiently large prime number $l$ which is prime to $p$, there exists a nontrivial 
$\mu_l$-torsor $Y$ of $X$ 
which is new-ordinary.  
\end{theorem} 

Let $\mathcal C_k$ be a category of Artinian local ring with residue field $k$. 
For a proper smooth connected scheme $T_0$, we define a deformation functor 
$$
      M_{T_0} : \mathcal C_k \rightarrow \mbox{(Sets)}, 
$$
that is, for $R \in \mathcal C_k$, the set $M_{T_0}(R)$ is a set of isomorphism classes of pairs $(T, \varphi)$ 
such that $T$ is a proper smooth scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, R$ and $\varphi$ is an isomorphism 
$T \times_{\mathrm{Spec}\, R}\mathrm{Spec}\, k \cong T_0$. If $T_0$ is a projective smooth connected curve 
or an Abelian variety, then $M_{T_0}$ is pro-representable by the formal spectrum of a ring of formal power series over $k$. 

Now let $l$ be a prime number which is prime to $p$, $X_0$ a projective smooth connected curve of genus $\geq 2$ 
over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, $\mu_l$ the locally constant etale sheaf consisting of $l$-th roots of unity, 
$Y_0$ a $\mu_l$-torsor of $X_0$ which associates to a nontrivial element $\mathcal L_0 \in J(X_0)[l](k) 
\cong H^1_{\mathrm{et}}(X_0, \mu_l)$, and $J(Y_0, X_0)$ the new part of Jacobian variety 
of $Y_0$ with respect to $X_0$. Then there is a canonical map 
$$
       T_{\mathcal L_0}(R) :  M_{X_0}(R) \rightarrow M_{J(Y_0, X_0)}(R)
$$
as follows. For $X \in M_{X_0}(R)$, there exists a unique $\mu_l$-torsor $f : Y \rightarrow X$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, R$
which is a lift of the $\mu_l$-torsor $f_0 : Y_0 \rightarrow X_0$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ 
by \cite[I, Corollaire 8.4]{SGA1}. Then $T_{\mathcal L_0}(R)(X)$ 
is the new part $J(Y, X) = J(Y)/f^\ast J(X)$ of the relative Jacobian variety 
$J(Y)$ of $Y$ with respect to the relative Jacobian variety $J(X)$ of $X$ with a natural isomorphism 
$J(Y, X) \times_{\mathrm{Spec}\, R}\mathrm{Spec}\, k \cong J(Y_0, X_0)$. 
Hence one has a Torelli morphism 
$$
         T_{\mathcal L_0} : M_{X_0} \rightarrow M_{J(Y_0, X_0)}. 
$$
By the numerical estimates in \cite[Corollaries 4.7, 5.3]{tam} one has 

\begin{theorem}\label{tore} \mbox{\rm (\cite[Theorem 3.3]{saidi})} With the notation as above, 
suppose that the gonality of $X_0$ is greater than or equal to $5$. 
Then, for any sufficiently large prime number $l$ which is prime to $p$, 
there exists a nontrivial element $\mathcal L_0 \in J(X_0)[l](k)$ such that 
the corresponding $\mu_l$-torsor $Y_0$ of $X_0$ is new-ordinary and 
the Torelli morphism $T_{\mathcal L_0}$ is an immersion. 
\end{theorem} 

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{isotcNP}.} 
First we prepare several assertions. 
Lemmas \ref{sai2} and \ref{etind} are higher dimensional generalizations 
of Lemma/Proposition 4.7 and Lemma 2 in \cite{saidi}, respectively. 

\begin{lemma}\label{sai2} Let $S$ be a smooth connected 
scheme separated of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
$f : X \rightarrow S$ be a projective smooth morphism over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ such that 
each fiber of $f$ is a connected curve, $t \in X(k(S)^{\mathrm{sep}})$ a point of degree $d_t$ over $k(S)$ 
where $k(S)^{\mathrm{sep}}$ is a separable closure of the function field $k(S)$ of $S$, 
and $n$ a positive integer which is prime to $pd_t$.   
Let us fix a closed point $s$ of $S$ and a $\mu_n$-torsor $Y_s$ of the fiber $X_s$ of $f$ at $s$. 
Then there exist a finite etale morphism $S' \rightarrow S$ with a base change morphism 
$f' : X' = X \times_S S' \rightarrow S'$ and a $\mu_n$-torsor 
$Y' \rightarrow X'$ such that, for $s' \in S'$ which goes to $s$ in $S$, the $\mu_n$-torsor $Y'_{s'}$ 
of $X'_{s'}$ is naturally isomorphic to $Y_s$ over $X_s$. 
\end{lemma}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {Since we may identify $\mu_n$ with the constant etale sheaf $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$, 
$R^1f_{\mathrm{et}\ast}\mu_n$ is locally constant. Moreover, we can take 
a finite etale cover $S'$ of $S$ such that $R^1f_{\mathrm{et}\ast}\mu_n$ is constant. 
Take a point $s' \in S'$ with a closed immersion $i_{s'} : s' \rightarrow S'$ 
such that $s'$ is above $s$. Then we have an 
isomorphism $i_{s'}^\ast R^1f_{\mathrm{et}\ast}'\mu_n \cong H_{\mathrm{et}}^1(X_{s'}, \mu_n)$ 
by proper base change theorem of etale cohomology. 
Since $R^1(f')_{\mathrm{et}\ast}\mu_n$ is constant, the natural homomorphism 
$$
      H_{\mathrm{et}}^0(S', R^1f_{\mathrm{et}\ast}'\mu_n) \rightarrow 
      H_{\mathrm{et}}^1(X_{s'}', \mu_n) \cong H_{\mathrm{et}}^1(X_s, \mu_n)
$$
is bijective. By compositing with the exact sequence 
$$
    0 \rightarrow H^1_{\mathrm{et}}(S', \mu_n) \rightarrow H^1_{\mathrm{et}}(X', \mu_n) 
    \rightarrow H_{\mathrm{et}}^0(S', R^1f_{\mathrm{et}\ast}'\mu_n) 
    \rightarrow H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(S', \mu_n) \rightarrow H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(X', \mu_n) 
$$
arising from Leray spectral sequence, 
we have only to prove that 
the natural homomorphism $H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(S', \mu_n) \rightarrow H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(X', \mu_n)$ is injective. 
Then the homomorphism 
$$
      H^1_{\mathrm{et}}(X', \mu_n) \rightarrow H_{\mathrm{et}}^1(X_s, \mu_n)
$$
is surjective, and hence there exists a $\mu_n$-torsor $Y' \rightarrow X'$ whose fiber at $s'$ is isomorphic to 
the given $\mu_n$-torsor $Y_s \rightarrow X_s$. 

Let $T$ be the normalization of $S$ in the function field $k(S)(t)$ of $t$. 
Then the restriction $g = f|_T : T \rightarrow S$ is generically etale and finite of degree $d_t$. 
If we put $T' = T\times_S S'$ with a finite morphism $g' : T' \rightarrow S'$, then we have a natural commutative diagram 
$$
     \begin{array}{ccccc}
          H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(S', \mu_n) &\overset{(f')^\ast}{\rightarrow} &H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(X', \mu_n) \\
          &(g')^\ast \searrow \hspace*{5mm}&\downarrow \\
          & &H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(T', \mu_n). 
     \end{array}
$$
The injectivity of $(f')^\ast$ follows from that of $(g')^\ast$ which is proved in Proposition \ref{inj} below. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\begin{proposition}\label{inj} 
Let $S$ be a smooth connected scheme separated of finite type over the 
spectrum $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ of an algebraic closed field $k$ of characteristic $p \geq 0$, 
and $g : T \rightarrow S$ a generically etale and finite morphism of degree $d$ 
such that $T$ is normal. 
Suppose $n$ is a positive integer which is prime to $dp$ (resp. $d$) if $p > 0$ (resp. $p = 0$). 
Then the homomorphism 
$$
       g^\ast : H_{\mathrm{et}}^2(S, \mu_n) \rightarrow H_{\mathrm{et}}^2(T, \mu_n)
$$
is injective. 
\end{proposition}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {
Let $U$ be an open dense subscheme of $S$ such that the inverse image 
$g^{-1}(U)$ is regular and the complement $E$ of $U$ in $S$ 
is of codimension $\geq 2$. Such a $U$ exists since $T$ is normal. 
Then we have a natural commutative diagram 
$$
     \begin{array}{ccccc}
          H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(S, \mu_n) &\overset{g^\ast}{\rightarrow} &H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(T, \mu_n) \\
          \downarrow & &\downarrow \\
          H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(U, \mu_n) &\underset{g^\ast}{\rightarrow} &H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(g^{-1}(U), \mu_n). 
     \end{array}
$$
Since the right vertical homomorphism is injective by the cohomological purity theorem \cite[VI, Theorem 5.1]{mil}, 
we may assume that $T$ is smooth over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 

Let us take a largest open dense subscheme $V$ of $S$ such that 
the inverse image $W = g^{-1}(V)$ is etale over $S$, and 
$E$ (resp. $F$) is the complement of $V$ (resp. $W$) in $S$ (resp. $T$). 
Let us now consider the commutative diagram 
$$

Note that Poincar\'e duality is applicable since $g : T \rightarrow S$ is a finite morphism of smooth schemes. 
Then the composite $g_\ast g^\ast$ in the left (resp. right) vertical homomorphisms

Hence, the middle $g_\ast g^\ast$ is surjective. Indeed, for any $a \in H_{\mathrm{et}}^2(S, \mu_n)$, there exists

\begin{lemma}\label{sure} With the notation in Proposition \ref{inj}, the followings hold.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any generic point of complement of $V$ in $S$ is pure of codimension $1$. 
The same holds for the complement of $W$ in $T$. 
\item Let $E_1, \cdots, E_r$ be reduced irreducible components of the complement $E$ of $V$ in $S$, 
and $F_{i,1}, \cdots, F_{i,s_i}$ the reduced irreducile components of the inverse image $F_i$ of $E_i$ in  $T$ 
with multiplicity $e_{i, j}$ of $F_{i, j}$ in $T \times_S E_i$ and the degree of $F_{i, j}$ over $E_i$ (here we consider 
the ramification index and the residual degree for the extension $\mathcal O_{T, F_{i, j}}/\mathcal O_{S, E_i}$ 
of discrete valuation rings, respectively). Then $\sum_j e_{i, j}f_{i, j} = d$ for any $i$.
\item The homomorphism 
$g^\ast : H_{\mathrm{et}, E_i}^2(S, \mu_n) \rightarrow H_{\mathrm{et}, F_i}^2(T, \mu_n)$

$E_i^{\mathrm{sm}} = E_i \setminus E_i^{\mathrm{sing}}$, 
and $(-1)$ means the $(-1)$-th Tate twist.

$g_\ast : H_{\mathrm{et}, F_i}^2(T, \mu_n) \rightarrow H_{\mathrm{et}, E_i}^2(S, \mu_n)$

(5) Since $H_{\mathrm{et}, E}^2(S, \mu_n) \cong \oplus_i, H_{\mathrm{et}, E_i}^2(S, \mu_n)$, 
the assertion follows from (2), (3), and (4).

\begin{lemma}\label{etind} Let $S$ be a projective smooth scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, 
and $X$ a proper smooth family of curves of genus $g \geq 2$. 
Let $S' \rightarrow S$ be a finite etale morphism and $Y' \rightarrow X' = X \times_SS'$ 
a finite etale morphism. If the family $Y'$ over $S'$ is isotrivial, then so is the family $X$ over $S$. 
\end{lemma} 

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {When $S$ is a curve, the lemma is just Lemma 2 in \cite[p.235]{saidi}. 
Let $T$ be a projective smooth curve in $S$, and $T', X_T, X_T', Y'_T$ base changes of $S', X, X', Y'$ 
by $T \rightarrow S$, respectively. Then the family $X_T$ over $T$ is isotrivial. 
By varying projective smooth curves in $S$,  there exists an open dense subscheme $U$ of $S$ such that 
$X_U = X \times_SU$ over $U$ is isotrivial by Bertini's theorem. Hence, the family $X$ over $S$ is isotrivial 
because the canonical morphism $S \rightarrow \mathfrak M_g$ is constant. 
Here $\mathfrak M_g$ is the coarse moduli scheme of projective smooth curves of genus $g$.

\vspace*{3mm}

Now we prove Theorem \ref{isotcNP}. 
The following arguments are essentially due to the proof of \cite[Theomre 4.6]{saidi}. 
Let us fix a closed point $s$ in $S$. If the fiber $X_s$ of $X$ at $s$ is ordinary, then 
the assertion follows from Corollary \ref{isJNP}. 
Hence we may suppose the fiber $X_s$ is not ordinary. 
Then there exist 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[$1^\circ$] (only in the case where the $p$-rank of $X_s$ is $0$; 
if not, then $S_0 = S$ and $s_0 = s$) a point $t_0$ of $X(k(S)^{\mathrm{sep}})$ 
of degree $d_0$, a finite etale morphism 
$S_0 \rightarrow S$ and a finite etale morphism 
$Y_0 \rightarrow X \times_SS_0$ such that, for a closed point $s_0$ of $S_0$ which goes to $s$ in $S$, 
$Y_0 \rightarrow X \times_SS_0$ is a $\mu_{l_0}$-torsor 
for a prime number $l_0$ which is prime to $pd_0$ and that 
the $p$-rank of the fiber $Y_{0, s_0}$ of $Y_0$ at $s_0$ is neither $0$ nor $g$;
\item[$2^\circ$] a point $t_1$ of $Y_0(k(S_0)^{\mathrm{sep}})$ 
of degree $d_1$, a finite etale morphism $S_1 \rightarrow S_0$ and a finite etale morphism 
$Y_1 \rightarrow X_1 = Y_0 \times_{S_0}S_1$ such that, for a closed point $s_1$ of $S_1$ which goes to $s_0$ in $S_0$, 
$Y_1 \rightarrow X_1$ is a $\mu_{l_1}$-torsor 
for a prime number $l_1$ which is prime to $pd_1$ and that 
the gonality of the fiber $Y_{1, s_1}$ of $Y_1$ at $s_1$ is greater than or equal to $5$;
\item[$3^\circ$] a point $t_2$ of $Y_1(k(S_1)^{\mathrm{sep}})$ 
of degree $d_2$, a finite etale morphism $S_2 \rightarrow S_1$, a prime number $l_2$ which is prime to $pd_2$, 
and a nontrivial $\mu_{l_2}$-torsor $Y_2 \rightarrow X_2 = Y_1 \times_{S_1}S_2$ such that, 
if $s_2$ is a closed point of $S_2$ which goes to $s_1$ in $S_1$ and 
$\mathcal L \in J(X_{2, s_2})[l_2](k)$ corresponds to 
the $\mu_{l_2}$-torsor $Y_{2, s_2} \rightarrow X_{2,s_2}$, then 
(i) $Y_{2, s_2} \rightarrow X_{2,s_2}$ is new-ordinary and 
(ii) the Torelli morphism $T_{\mathcal L} : M_{X_{2, s_2}} \rightarrow M_{J(Y_{2, s_2}, X_{2,s_2})}$ is an immersion.
\end{enumerate}
by Theorem \ref{neword} and Lemma \ref{sai2} for $1^\circ$, 
by Theorem \ref{exon} and Lemma \ref{sai2} for $2^\circ$ 
and by Theorem \ref{tore} and Lemma \ref{sai2} for $3^\circ$. 
Note that the gonality of $X_{2, s_2} \cong Y_{1, s_1}$ is greater than or equal to $5$ by $2^\circ$. 
In this situation we have only to prove the family $X_2$ over $S_2$ is isotrivial by Lemma \ref{etind}. 
Let $J(X_2)$ and $J(Y_2)$ be relative Jacobian varieties over $S_2$ and define the new part 
$$
          J(Y_2, X_2) = J(Y_2)/f_2^\ast J(X_2)
$$
where $f : Y_2 \rightarrow X_2$ is the canonical morphism. 
Then $J(Y_2, X_2)$ is a polarized Abelian scheme over $S_2$. 
Since $J(Y_2, X_2)_{s_2} = J(Y_{2, s_2}, X_{2,s_2})$ is an ordinary Abelian variety, the family $J(Y_2, X_2)$ over $S_2$ 
is isotrivial by Theorem \ref{isNP}. Hence the family $X_2$ is isotrivial over $S_2$ 
since the Torelli morphism $T_{\mathcal L}$ is an immersion by our construction. 
This completes a proof.

\subsection{Existence of convergent $F$-isocrystals with non constant Newton polygons}\label{nonisotsec}

In the study of nonconstant geometric etale fundamental groups on a family, 
M.Sa\"idi proved the following theorem. 

\begin{theorem}\label{nonisot} \mbox{\rm (\cite[Theorem 4.6]{saidi})} Let $C$ 
be a projective smooth and connected curve over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$, and $f : X \rightarrow C$ 
a proper smooth family of connected curves of genus $\geq 2$. 
If $X$ is not isotrivial over $C$, then there exist a finite etale covering $C'$ of $C$ 
and a proper smooth family $f' : X' \rightarrow C'$ of connected curves 
such that the $p$-ranks of fibers $X_s'\, (s \in C')$ are not constant. 
\end{theorem}

Since there always exists a projective smooth and connected curve $C$ with 
a nonisotrivial family of curves (see \cite[Theorem 3.1]{oort},  \cite{Dia}), 
we have an existence theorem below. 
Moreover, such a curve $C$ and a convergent $F$-isocrystal are possibly defined 
over a finite base field in any characteristic $p$. 

\begin{corollary}\label{extncnp} 
There exist a projective smooth and connected curve $C$ over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k$ 
and a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $C/K$ with nonconstant Newton polygons.
\end{corollary}

\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{fil}.}\label{esf}

\subsection{First reduction}\label{filas}

In this appendix we will prove the following theorem. 

\begin{theorem}\label{fila} 
Let $X$ be a smooth scheme separated of finite type over $k$, and $\mathcal M$ 
a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$. Suppose that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[($\ast$)] the initial slope of $\mathcal M$ 
at the generic point of $X$ is $0$ of rank $r_0$ 
and the multiplicity of slope $0$ in $F$-isocrystal $i_x^\ast\mathcal M$ is constant on $x \in X$. 
\end{enumerate}
Then there exists a unit-root convergent sub $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal L$ of $\mathcal M$ on $X/K$ of rank $r_0$. 
\end{theorem}

Theorem \ref{fil} follows from the theorem above. Indeed, 
by taking a ramified finite extension $K'$ of $K$ 
with an extension of Frobenius such that the valuation corresponding 
to the initial slope is contained in the valuation group of $K'$, 
we can reduce the assertion to that in the case where the initial slope is $0$ 
by Lemma \ref{sca} below. 
Hence Theorem \ref{fila} above implies Theorem \ref{fil}. 

\begin{lemma}\label{sca} Let $K'$ be a finite extension of $K$ with a residue field $k'$ such that there 
exists a $q$-Frobenius $\sigma'$ on $K'$ satisfying $\sigma'|_K = \sigma$, 
and put $X' = X \times_{\mathrm{Spec}\, k}\mathrm{Spec}\, k$. 
Let $\mathcal M$ be a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$, and $\mathcal M'$ a convergent $F$-isocrystal 
on $X'/K'$ which is an inverse image of $\mathcal M$. Suppose there exists a convergent sub $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal L'$ 
of $\mathcal M'$ such that all slopes of $i_{\overline{x}}^\ast(\mathcal M'/\mathcal L')$ 
is greater than those of $i_{\overline{x}}^\ast\mathcal L'$ for any geometric point $\overline{x}$ of $X$. 
Then there exists a convergent sub $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal L$ of $\mathcal M$ 
such that the inverse image of $\mathcal L$ on $X'/K'$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal L'$. 
\end{lemma}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {Let $g : X' \rightarrow X$ be a canonical morphism. If we put $\mathcal L$ 
to be the kernel of the natural homomorphism $\mathcal M \rightarrow g_\ast\mathcal M'/g_\ast\mathcal L'$, i.e., 
$$
      \mathcal L = \mathrm{Ker}(\mathcal M \rightarrow g_\ast\mathcal M'/g_\ast\mathcal L'), 
$$
then $\mathcal L$ is the desired convergent sub $F$-isocrystal of $\mathcal M$ by the hypothesis of slopes.} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\vspace*{3mm}

We may also assume that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $\mathbb F_q \subset k$ and $K_\sigma \otimes_{W(\mathbb F_q)}W(k) \cong K$, where 
our Frobenius $\sigma$ on $K$ is a $q$-Frobenius;  
\item[(ii)] $X$ is geometrically connected
\end{enumerate}
in order to prove Theorem \ref{fila} again by Remark \ref{frob} and Lemma \ref{sca}. 

Let $\mathcal M$ be  a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ which satisfies the 
hypothesis of Theorem \ref{fila}. Our method of the proof of Theorem \ref{fila} is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[$1^\circ$] To construct a $\mathrm{Gal}(k(X)^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(X))$-representation $V(\mathcal M)$ 
over $K_\sigma$ which corresponds to the unit-root sub of $M$ at the generic fiber. 
Here $k(X)$ is the function field of $X$ and $k(X)^{\mathrm{sep}}$ is 
a separable closure of $k(X)$. 
\item[$2^\circ$] To show $V(\mathcal M)$ is unramifield at each point of $X$ of codimension $1$. 
Then $V(\mathcal M)$ is a representation of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)$ by Zariski-Nagata purity theorem \cite[X, Theorem 3.4]{SGA2}. 
\item[$3^\circ$] To take a unit-root convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal L$ on $X/K$ by Katz-Crew equivalence 
\cite[Theorem 2.1]{Cr}. 
\item[$4^\circ$] To show $\mathcal L$ is a subobject of $\mathcal M$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{$(\varphi, \nabla)$-modules over $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$}

Let us assume that the residue field $k$ of $K$ is arbitrary of characteristic $p$ (allowing a non perfect field) 
and $\sigma$ is a $q$-Frobenius on $K$. We also suppose 
there is a $\sigma$-stable Cohen subring $R_0$ of $R$ such that (i) the residue field $R_0$ is $k$, 
(ii) $\mathbb F_q \subset k$ and (iii) $K_\sigma \otimes_{W(\mathbb F_q)}R_0 \cong K$. 

Let us put $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0 
= R[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]\otimes_RK$ 
(resp. $\mathcal E = \widehat{K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0[1/t]}$ 
to be the $p$-adic completion of $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0[1/t]$), 
and $\varphi$ a Frobenius on $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ 
(resp. the unique extension of $\varphi$ to $\mathcal E$) 
with respect to $\sigma$, that is, 
$\varphi(a) \equiv a^q\, (\mathrm{mod}\, \mathbf m)$ for $a \in R[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]$ 
and $\varphi|_R = \sigma$. 
We define Gauss norm on $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ (resp. $\mathcal E$) by 
$$
     \left|\sum_n\, a_nt^n\right|_{\mathrm{Gauss}} = \underset{n}{\mathrm{sup}}\, |a_n|_p, 
$$
where $|a|_p = p^{-\mathrm{ord}_p(a)}$ is the $p$-adic norm. 
Note that $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ (resp. $\mathcal E$) 
is a principal ideal domain by Weierestrass preparation theorem 
(resp. a completely discrete valuation field). $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ is complete 
in $(t, p)$-adic topology. 

For either $B = K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ or $\mathcal E$, 
a $(\varphi, \nabla)$-module $(M, \nabla, \Phi)$ over $B$ 
is a free $B$-module 
of finite rank with a $K$-connection $\nabla : M \rightarrow M \otimes_B\Omega_{B/K}^1, \, 
(\Omega_{B/K}^1 = Bdt)$ 
and a Frobenius $\Phi : \varphi^\ast M\, \displaystyle{\mathop{\rightarrow}^{\cong}}\, M$ such that  
$\Phi$ is a horizontal isomorphism with respect to connections. 
Then the category of $(\varphi, \nabla)$-modules over $B$ is Abelian 
and it is independent of the choice of $\varphi$ up to canonical equivalences. 

A generic slope (resp. a special slope) 
of a $(\varphi, \nabla)$-module $M$ over $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ 
is a slope of the $(\varphi, \nabla)$-module $M \otimes_{K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0}\mathcal E$ 
over $\mathcal E$ (resp. the $\sigma$-module $M \otimes_{K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0} K$ 
over $K$, where $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0 \rightarrow K$ is defined by $\sum_na_nt^n \mapsto a_0$). 
We also define the Newton polygons at the genetic point and at the special point by the generic slopes 
and the special slopes respectively, 
and the slope filtration on $(\varphi, \nabla)$-module over $\mathcal E$  
and $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ 
by the same manner if it exists. 

\begin{theorem}\label{sfil} 
With the notation above, we have the following. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \mbox{\rm (\cite[Remark 1.7.8]{Ke0}, \cite[Theorems 2.4]{CT})}
Any $(\varphi, \nabla)$-module $M$ over $\mathcal E$ 
admits a slope filtration $\{ S_\lambda M \}_\lambda$ as $(\varphi, \nabla)$-modules over $\mathcal E$. 
\item \mbox{\rm (\cite[Corollary 2.6.2]{Kat} if $k$ is perfect, 
\cite[Theorems 6.21]{CT} in general)} 
If a $(\varphi, \nabla)$-module $M$ over $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ 
has constant Newton polygons 
(both generic and special Newton polygons are same), then 
$M$ admits a slope filtration $\{ S_\lambda M \}_\lambda$ as $(\varphi, \nabla)$-modules over 
$K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$. 
Moreover, if the residue field $k$ of $K$ is separable closed, then 
$S_0 M \cong (K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0)^r$ as $(\varphi, \nabla)$-modules 
over $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\vspace*{3mm}

Let $k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{sep}}$ 
(resp. $k^{\mathrm{sep}}$, resp. $k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{ur}}$) 
be a separable closure of $k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})$, 
(resp. the separable closure of $k$ in $k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{sep}}$, 
resp. the maximal 
unramified extension of $k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})$ in $k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{sep}}$), 
and $\widehat{\mathcal E}^{\mathrm{nr}}$ (resp. $\widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}}$) a $p$-adic completion 
of maximal unramified extension $\mathcal E^{\mathrm{nr}}$ (resp. $K^{\mathrm{ur}}$) 
of $\mathcal E$ (resp. $K$) with residue field $k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{sep}}$ 
(resp. $k^{\mathrm{sep}}$). 
Then $\sigma$ extends on $\widehat{\mathcal E}^{\mathrm{nr}}$ and $\widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}}$ uniquely. 
We also use the same notation $\sigma$ on the extensions.
For a $\sigma$-module $M$ over $\mathcal E$, we put 
$$
     V_{\mathcal E}(M) = \mathrm{Ker}(1 -\Phi\otimes\sigma; M \otimes_{\mathcal E} \widehat{\mathcal E}^{\mathrm{nr}}). 
$$
Then $V_{\mathcal E}(M)$ is an $K_\sigma (= \mathcal E_\sigma)$-space 
of dimension less than or equal to $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathcal E}M$ with 
a continuous action of 
$\mathrm{Gal}(k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})) 
= \mathrm{Gal}(\mathcal E^{\mathrm{ur}}/\mathcal E)$ 
by acting $1 \otimes \tau$ for $\tau \in 
\mathrm{Gal}(k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm}))$. 
We also define $V_K(N)$ by the same manner for an $F$-space $N$ over $K$. 

\begin{proposition}\label{rep} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $M$ be a $(\varphi, \nabla)$-module over $\mathcal E$ with 
the slope filtration $\{ S_\lambda M\}_\lambda$ such that $S_\lambda M = 0$ for $\lambda < 0$
and $r_0 = \mathrm{dim}_{\mathcal E}\, S_0M$. 
Then $V_{\mathcal E}(M) = V_{\mathcal E}(S_0M)$ is a $K_\sigma$-space of dimension $r_0$ 
with a continuous 
$\mathrm{Gal}(k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm}))$-representation. 
\item Let $M$ be a $(\varphi, \nabla)$-module over $K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$ with 
the slope filtration $\{ S_\lambda M\}_\lambda$ such that $S_\lambda M = 0$ for $\lambda < 0$. 
Then there are natural isomorphisms
$$
      V_{\mathcal E}(M \otimes_{K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0} \mathcal E)\, \overset{\cong}{\leftarrow}\,  
      \mathrm{Ker}(1 -\Phi\otimes\sigma; M \otimes_{K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0} 
      \widehat{K}^{\mathrm{ur}}[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0) \overset{\cong}{\rightarrow}
      V_K(M \otimes_{K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0} K)
$$
which are compatible with the action of the Galois group 
$\mathrm{Gal}(k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm})^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(\hspace*{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace*{-0.5mm}))$. 
In particular, the representation 
$V_{\mathcal E}(M \otimes_{K[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0} \mathcal E)$ is unramified, that is, 
the Galois group  
acts via the quotient

\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {(2) Since the Newton polygons of $M$ both at the generic point and the special point coincide, 
both homomorphisms are bijective by Theorem \ref{sfil}. By the construction

} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\subsection{Construction of a functor $V$}

Now we return to the situation of Theorem \ref{fila} with the assumptions at the end of section \ref{filas}. 
We may assume that $X$ is affine and there exists a smooth affine formal 
scheme $\mathrm{Spf}\, A$ 
topologically of finite type over $\mathrm{Spf}\, R$ such that $X = \mathrm{Spec}\, A \otimes_R R/\mathbf m$ 
and $A$ is furnished with a Frobenius endomorphism $\varphi$ compatible to $\sigma$, 
i.e., a continuous ring homomorphism satisfying $\varphi(a)\, \equiv\, a^q\, (\mathrm{mod}\, \mathbf m)$ and 
$\varphi|_R = \sigma$. Such an $A$ exists by \cite[Th\'eor\`eme 6]{El}. 

Let $\mathcal M$ be  a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ which satisfies the 
hypothesis of Theorem \ref{fila}. 
Put $M = \Gamma(]X[_{\mathrm{Spf}\, A}, \mathcal M)$. Then $M$  
is a projective $A$-module of finite type which is furnished with an integrable connection 
$\nabla : M \rightarrow M\otimes_A \Omega_{\mathrm{Spf}\, A/\mathrm{Spf}\, R}^1$ 
and a Frobenius $\Phi : \varphi^\ast M\, \displaystyle{\mathop{\rightarrow}^{\cong}}\, M$ which is 
horizontal with respect to integrable connections. 

Let $E$ be a field of fractions of the $p$-adic completion $\widehat{A}_{\mathbf m}$ 
of the localization $A_{\mathbf m}$ at $\mathbf mA$. Then $\widehat{A}_{\mathbf m}/\mathbf m\widehat{A}_{\mathbf m} = k(X)$, 
the field of functions on $X$. 
We define a $K_\sigma$-space ($(\widehat{E}^{\mathrm{ur}})_\varphi = K_\sigma$) by 
$$
    V(\mathcal M) = \mathrm{Ker}(1 -\Phi\otimes\sigma; M \otimes_{A[1/p]}\widehat{E}^{\mathrm{ur}}). 
$$
Then $V(\mathcal M)$ is a $K_\sigma$-space of rank $r_0$ 
with a continuous action of the Galois group 
$$
      \mathrm{Gal}(k(X)^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(X)) = \mathrm{Gal}(E^{\mathrm{ur}}/E). 
$$
Since $\mathcal M$ is a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$, $V(\mathcal M)$ does not depend on the choice of the Frobenius 
endomorphism $\varphi$ on $\mathrm{Spf}\, A$ and also on the choice of $\mathrm{Spf}\, A$ up to canonical isomorphisms. 

Applying Proposition \ref{rep} at each point of $X$ of codimension $1$, we have 
the following proposition. 

\begin{proposition}\label{unr} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(k(X)^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(X))$ 
acts on $V(\mathcal M)$ via the etale fundamental group 
$\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)$ of $X$. 
\item There is a natural isomorphism $V(\mathcal M\otimes_{\mathcal O_{]X[}}\mathcal N) \cong 
V(\mathcal M) \otimes_{K_\sigma} V(\mathcal N)$ as representations of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)$ 
for convergent $F$-isocrystals $\mathcal M$ and $\mathcal N$ on $X/K$ 
such that both $\mathcal M$ and $\mathcal N$ satisfy the hypothesis $(\ast)$ in Theorem \ref{fila}. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {(1) Let $x$ be a point of $X$ of codimension $1$, and $\mathbf p_x$ the inverse image 
of the prime ideal associated to $x$ by the natural surjection $A \rightarrow A/\mathbf mA$. 
Let $A_x$ be a localization of $A$ at $\mathbf p_x$, $\widehat{A}_x$ the completion of $A_x$ along $\mathbf p_x$, 
$\mathbf p_x\widehat{A}_x = (\mathbf m, t_x)\widehat{A}_x$ for a parameter $t_x \in A_x$, 
and $K_x$ the field of fractions of $A_x/t_xA_x$. 
Such $t_x$ can be taken since $A_x$ is a regular local domain of dimension $2$ 
with the maximal ideal $\mathbf p_x\widehat{A}_x$. 
The ring $\widehat{A}_x$ is integral and we have an isomorphism 
$\widehat{A}_x[1/p] \cong K_x[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t_x]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0$. 
We put $\mathcal E_x$ to be the $p$-adic completion of $K_x[\hspace*{-0.6mm}[t_x]\hspace*{-0.6mm}]_0[1/t_x]$ 
and we regard $E$ as a subfield of $\mathcal E_x$ by the natural injection 
$A \rightarrow \mathcal E_x$. 

Since the natural sequence of isomorphisms 
$$
  V(\mathcal M) \overset{\cong}{\rightarrow} V_E(M \otimes_{A[1/p]} E) 
    \overset{\cong}{\rightarrow}  V_{\mathcal E_x}(M \otimes_{A[1/p]} \mathcal E_x) 
$$
are compatible with Galois actions, $V(\mathcal M)$ is unramified at $x$ 
by Proposition \ref{rep}. Since $x$ is arbitrary of codimension $1$, 
$V(\mathcal M)$ is a representation of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)$ by Zariski-Nagata purity theorem 
\cite[X, Theorem 3.4]{SGA2}. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\vspace*{3mm}

Our functor $V$ is compatible to Katz-Crew equivalence. 

\begin{theorem}\label{crew} Let $X$ be a smooth geometrically connected scheme of finite type over $k$. 
Then the functor $V$ is compatible with the functor $V^0$ of Katz-Crew's equivalence: 
$$
     \begin{array}{ccc}
      F\mbox{\rm -Isoc}(X/K) &\overset{V}{\longrightarrow} &\mbox{\rm Rep}_{K_\sigma}(\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)) \\
            \bigcup&\underset{V^0}{\nearrow} & \\
           F\mbox{\rm -Isoc}(X/K)^0 
           \end{array}
$$
where $F\mbox{\rm -Isoc}(X/K)^0$ is the full subcategory of 
$F\mbox{\rm -Isoc}(X/K)$ consisting of unit-root $F$-isocrystals and 
$\mbox{\rm Rep}_{K_\sigma}(\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X))$ is the category of 
continuous finite dimensional 
$K_\sigma$-representation of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)$.  
\end{theorem}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {We recall the proof of equivalence of $V^0$ by Crew in \cite[Section 2]{Cr}. 
Let $\mathcal M$ be a unit-root convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ of rank $r_0$. 
By patching technique, we may assume that $X$ is affine, and hence we follow the notation at the beginning of this 
subsection. 
Let $\mathcal M$ be a unit-root convergent $F$-iscrystal on $X/K$. 
Since $\mathcal M$ is unit-root, 
there is a locally free $\mathcal O_{\mathrm{Spf}\, A}$-module 
of finite rank such that $\mathcal L \otimes_RK = \mathcal M$, 
$\mathcal L$ is stable under the Frobenius $\Phi$ 
and that $\Phi : \varphi^\ast \mathcal L \rightarrow \mathcal L$ 
is an isomorphism of $\mathcal O_{\mathrm{Spf}\, A}$-modules 
(the unit-root condition). 
Such an $\mathcal L$ is called an $F$-lattice $\mathcal M$ and 
it always exists by \cite[Proposition 2.5]{Cr}. 
Then there is a sequence 
$$
     X \leftarrow X_1 \leftarrow X_2 \leftarrow X_3 \leftarrow \cdots
$$
of finite etale Galois coverings of $X$ with structure morphisms $\pi_n : X_n \rightarrow X$ such that 
$\pi^\ast_n(\mathcal L/\mathbf m^n\mathcal L)$ is a trivial $\varphi_n$-module over $A_n$, 
and that the sequence 
$$
     \mathrm{Spf}\, A \leftarrow \mathrm{Spf}\, A_1 \leftarrow \mathrm{Spf}\, A_2 \leftarrow \cdots, 
$$
lifts on $\mathrm{Spf}\, R$ with Frobenius $\varphi_n$. 
Then 
$$
\Gamma_n = \mathrm{Ker}\left(1 - \Phi\otimes \varphi_n; 
\Gamma(\mathrm{Spf}\, A_n, \pi^\ast_n(\mathcal L/\mathbf m^n\mathcal L))\right)
$$ 
is a free $R_\sigma/\mathbf m^nR_\sigma$-module of rank $r_0$ 
with an action of $\mathrm{Gal}(X_n/X)$. 
Here $R_\sigma$ is the integer ring of $K_\sigma$. 
If one puts  
$$
   \begin{array}{l}
     \widehat{B} = \mbox{the $p$-adic completion of}\, \, \cup_n A_n \\
     \widehat\varphi = \mbox{the continuous extension of}\, \, 
     \displaystyle{\mathop{\mathrm{lim}}_{\underset n{\rightarrow}}}\, \varphi_n, 
   \end{array}
$$
then we have 
$$
      V^0(\mathcal M) := K_\sigma \otimes_{R_\sigma} \displaystyle{\mathop{\mathrm{lim}}_{\underset n{\leftarrow}}}\, \Gamma_n 
      \cong K_\sigma \otimes_{R_\sigma} \mathrm{Ker}\left(1 - \Phi \otimes \widehat{\varphi}; 
      \Gamma(\mathrm{Spf}\, A, \mathcal L) \otimes_A\widehat{B} \right) 
      \subset V(\mathcal M)
$$
as $K_\sigma$-spaces with continuous $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)$-actions since 
$\widehat{B} \subset \widehat{E}^{\mathrm{ur}}$. 
Comparing the dimension over $K_\sigma$, we have an isomorphism 
$$
V(\mathcal M) \cong V^0(\mathcal M)
$$ 
and Crew's construction coincides with ours. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\subsection{End of the proof of Theorem \ref{fila}} 
Keep the notation as in the previous section. 

\begin{lemma}\label{unitsub} 
Let $\mathcal M$ be a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ which satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem \ref{fila}. 
Suppose that $V(\mathcal M)$ contains a trivial representation $V_0 (\cong K_\sigma)$ of rank $1$. Then there exists a 
convergent sub $F$-isocrystal of $\mathcal M$ which is isomorphic to 
the unit-root trivial object $(\mathcal O_{]X[}, d, \varphi)$ of rank $1$. 
\end{lemma}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {We may suppose $X$ is affine and 
the same geometric situation as in the proof of Proposition \ref{unr} holds. 
Let us put $M = \Gamma(]X[_{\mathrm{Spf}\, A}, \mathcal M)$. Then $M$ is a projective $A[1/p]$-module of finite type. 
Our claim is that 
$V_0 \subset M$ under the inclusion $V_0 \subset V(\mathcal M) 
= \mathrm{Ker}(1-\Phi\otimes\varphi; M \otimes_{A[1/p]}\otimes \widehat{E}^{\mathrm{un}}) \subset 
M \otimes_{A[1/p]}\otimes \widehat{E}^{\mathrm{un}}$. 
Since $V_0$ is 
$\mathrm{Gal}(k(X)^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(X))$-invariant, 
$V_0$ is included in $M \otimes_{A[1/p]} E$. 

Let us take a point $x$ of $X$ of codimension $1$, and keep the notation as in the proof of Proposition \ref{unr}. 
Since $V(\mathcal M) =\mathrm{Ker}(1 - \Phi\otimes\sigma; M \otimes_{A[1/p]} \widehat{A}_x[1/p])$ 
by Proposition \ref{rep}, 
$V_0$ is included in $M \otimes_{A[1/p]} \widehat{A}_x[1/p]$. 
Moreover, $M$ is a direct summand of a free $A[1/p]$-module of finite type, the equality 
$$
    M\otimes_{A[1/p]} A_x[1/p] = (M \otimes_{A[1/p]} E) \cap (M \otimes_{A[1/p]} \widehat{A}_x[1/p])
$$
holds in $M \otimes_{A[1/p]} \mathcal E_x$ by Lemma \ref{int} (1). Hence 
$V_0$ is included in $M\otimes_{A[1/p]} A_x[1/p]$. 
Now our claim $V_0 \subset M$ follows from Lemma \ref{int} (2). 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\begin{lemma}\label{int} With the notation above, we have
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A_x[1/p] = E \cap \widehat{A}_x[1/p]$. 
\item $A[1/p] = \underset{x}{\cap}\, A_x[1/p]$, where 
$x$ runs through all points $x \in X$ of codimension $1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

{\noindent {\sc Proof.} {Since $A[1/p]$ is Noetherian normal domain, 
the assertion follows $\mathrm{Spec}\, A_x[1/p] = \mathrm{Spec}\, \widehat{A}_x[1/p]$ 
and $\mathrm{Spec}\, A[1/p] = \coprod_x\mathrm{Spec}\,A_x[1/p]\, \mbox{(a disjoint sum)}$. 
} \hspace*{\fill} $\Box$}

\vspace*{3mm}

Now let us complete a proof of Theorem \ref{fila}. 
Let $\mathcal M$ be a convergent $F$-isocrystal on $X/K$ which satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem \ref{fila}. 
Then there is a continuous $K_\sigma$-representation $V(\mathcal M)$ of $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(X)$ of dimension $r$. 
By Katz-Crew's quasi-inverse $D^0$ of $V^0$, 
we have a unit-root convergent $F$-isocrystal $\mathcal L = D^0(V(\mathcal M))$ 
on $X/K$ of rank $r_0$. We have only to prove that there exists a nontrivial homomorphism 
$\mathcal L \rightarrow \mathcal M$. Indeed, by applying this argument to the quotient 
$\mathcal M/\mathrm{Im}(\mathcal L \rightarrow \mathcal M)$ iteratedly, 
one has the maximal quotient $\mathcal N$ of $\mathcal M$ such that 
$\mathcal N$ is of rank $\mathrm{rank}\, \mathcal M - r_0$ 
and it has no slope $0$ sub at the generic point. Then the kernel of $\mathcal M \rightarrow \mathcal N$ 
is a unit-root sub object and it is isomorphic to $\mathcal L$ by Katz-Crew equivalence. 

Applying Proposition \ref{unr} and Lemma \ref{unitsub} to $\mathcal L^\vee \otimes_{\mathcal  O_{]X[}}\mathcal M$, 
we have a unit-root trivial convergent subobject in $\mathcal L^\vee \otimes_{\mathcal  O_{]X[}} \mathcal M$. 
Hence we have a nontrivial homomorphism $\mathcal L \rightarrow \mathcal M$.
